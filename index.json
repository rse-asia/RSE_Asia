This was following my participation in the Collaborations Workshop 2025 organised by the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) at the University of Stirling. I was joined by SSI Fellows Samantha Wittke and Saranjeet Kaur.\nOn the day, Catherine Inglis and Neil Chue Hong welcomed us to the Bayes Centre at EPCC. The robots on the ground floor of the Bayes Centre are hard to miss, and I must say, I was captivated by them! We all went on a tour of the EPCC building and met several members of the team there. Later, we stepped out and had a lunch break in the beautiful and sunny campus of the University of Edinburgh. It was during the chats with Catherine and Neil, I got to know that the Unicorn 🦄 - an imaginary creature - is the National Animal of Scotland, and then it made sense to me why the buildings in Edinburgh have so many unicorn statues!\nThere were two talks planned for the day. The first one was by Samantha, who shared about the CodeRefinery project and her work with the Nordic RSE. Later, I presented my talk on the ongoing ‘Research Study on the Research Software Engineering (RSEng) Landscape in Asia’. Coincidentally, there were a few common points touched during both the talks - maybe CodeRefinery and RSE Asia could collaborate more closely in the future, but for now, I will focus this blog on my talk! 😊\nWhat is RSE Asia? We (I and my co-Founder Saranjeet Kaur) launched the Research Software Engineering Asia Association (RSE Asia) back in 2021, on the very first International RSE Day, as there was almost no awareness about Research Software Engineering in the Asian region. Over the past 3+ years we have conducted and participated in various events and workshops to raise awareness about the profession and the community. Based on the reflections over this period, I started to explore the RSE landscape in the Asian region to get better informed insights.\nWhat is my project about? The motivation for this project was gained after reflecting over several of the community initiatives and interactions that RSE Asia had with the community in the region. I was further encouraged to take this work ahead when I proposed the idea during my talk on ‘What is Research Software and Why Should we Think About its Sustainability?’ at the 58th meeting of the Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN58) during August 2024, which was attended by delegates from across Asia Pacific as well as the globe. I have been developing this idea since then, and have been encouraged and supported to do so by several RSE community members, SSI fellows, and community leaders.\nSpeaking of why this study is required - this study is essential for several reasons, some of which are the need to diversify and expand the research software landscape, attempt to address the lack of formal RSE roles in Asia, leverage international partnerships, and further build a supportive community within Asia.\nSSI has been conducting surveys to study the RSE landscape since 2018. However, there has been almost no representation of Asia in these surveys. This makes my research study even more essential.\nWithin Asia, the Asia-Pacific Advanced Network (APAN) is an organisation that represents member institutions as well as it is a backbone network connecting member countries and regions to each other and to other international research and education networks. I am a member of APAN’s Open and Sharing Data Working Group (OSDWG). This working group engages in dialogue and activities to promote good open science practices within research roles/institutes in the Asia Pacific. RSE Asia has had a consistent voice and representation during the biannual APAN meetings as a part of this working group. Through these engagements we realised the common interests we share with the working group and their intentions to help support the objectives of RSE Asia. Asia being a very complex and diverse region both, culturally and economically, it is essential to have the support from an established working group like the APAN’s OSDWG so as to have a better understanding of the research software landscape in the region.\nSo far in this project, I have been able to refine and adapt the existing SSI surveys to make them suitable for the Asian context. I have also launched a pilot survey with a small group in APAN’s OSDWG to gain first-hand feedback on the survey so far. Next, I plan to refine the survey further based on this feedback before launching the full survey to a larger group. If you are either a researcher based in Asia or have worked in the Asian region or collaborate with colleagues in Asia, then please watch the RSE Asia page for updates about my project and the survey - I would love to hear from you!\n🎉 Concluding the day After the talks, we spent some time discussing our work with the audience, which smoothly transitioned into EPCC’s ritual of ‘Friday …","date":1748476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1748476800,"objectID":"7c0cde165eeb6814436ce81f5784861c","permalink":"https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/blog/2025-05-27_epcc_talk/","publishdate":"2025-05-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/RSE_Asia/blog/2025-05-27_epcc_talk/","section":"blog","summary":"In this blog, I walk you through my visit to the EPCC, University of Edinburgh where I was invited for a talk for my work towards the RSE Asia Association!","tags":null,"title":"Halò Scotland!

FOSS, an acronym for Free and Open Source Software, embodies a software development philosophy centered on freedom and openness. The term ‘Free’ denotes users’ liberty to run, alter, and share the software, while ‘Open Source’ signifies that the software’s source code is available for users to inspect, modify, and contribute to its progress. FOSS promotes collaboration, transparency, and user empowerment. This frequently leads to the creation of more secure and sustainable software projects. Notable examples of FOSS include Linux, Blender, Chromium, Kubernetes, and Mozilla Firefox, among many more.\n🧑‍💻🌏 What is FOSSASIA? FOSSASIA is an organisation developing Open Source software applications and Open Hardware together with a global community from its base in Asia. Their goal is to provide access to open technologies, science applications and knowledge that improve people’s lives. They enable people to adapt and change technology according to their own ideas and needs, and validate science and knowledge through an Open Access approach. It was established in 2009 by Hong Phuc Dang and Mario Behling. They organise and participate in conferences, meetups and code camps. The annual FOSSASIA Summit is one of the top tech events in Asia. FOSSASIA also runs a number of coding programs, such as Codeheat.\nThe 15th edition of FOSSASIA Summit was organised at True Digital Park, Bangkok, Thailand from 13th to 15th March 2025. It brought together individuals sharing talks on topics around Free and Open Source Software. The Summit had multiple parallel track sessions like talks, lightning talks, workshops, and more! There were booths by various organisations creating and/or using Free and Open Source Software. This was my first experience of attending FOSSASIA in-person in Thailand.\n🗓️ Day 1 The day started with a lot of fervour. Following the welcome session by Hong Phuc Dang, there were multiple parallel tracks of talks. One of the booths demonstrated Robot Jupiter (image below) - an interactive virtual education assistant!\nI had a chance to speak to Nancy Reyes, a representative from the A11y Accessibility Labs. She was showcasing the hardware items that they use for digital accessibility awareness training during their Usability and Accessibility Clinic sessions.\nA picture with Nancy Reyes, from the A11y Accessibility Labs, speaking about the mission of the RSE Asia Association.\n🗓️ Day 2 The second day of the summit, 14th March, was themed as PGDay 2025, a 1-day event focused on the PostgreSQL database, which was held in conjunction with the FOSSASIA Summit. I learnt about a new tool - pgroll. It is an open-source command-line tool designed for PostgreSQL, ensuring that schema updates are applied safely, without locking the database, and enabling multiple schema versions to coexist. This ensures uninterrupted operation for client applications during migration, even when introducing breaking changes. The tool’s capability to automatically backfill columns and support instant rollbacks further enhances its reliability.\nLater that day, I came across the booth of Grafana Labs. As I spoke to Richard Hartmann, he shared about the useful features of Grafana Labs tools for creating reports, metrics, and graphs about the code being written.\n🗓️ Day 3 I held a ‘Meet \u0026amp; Greet Spot’ to speak to people about the field of Research Software Engineering, and discussed how it is a career path where one can combine their interest in implementing their research skills along with programming skills. I also shared about the past and the upcoming activities of the Research Software Engineering (RSE) Asia Association. Most people were curious to learn more about it, and also expressed a desire to join the future events held for the community.\n👥 Cultural Warmth From the moment I arrived at the Suvarnabhumi airport, I found everyone to be warm and welcoming. People at help desks, metro ticket counters, and even local markets were kind and helped me get around the city easily. I also learned something new about Thailand — it’s a pedestrian-first country, where vehicles stop to let people cross the road. Another thing I noticed was a good gender balance in the different workplaces that I came across.\nWith fresh fruits like mangoes, jackfruits, bananas, guavas, cashews, and coconuts, I truly experienced the tropical feel of the country. I enjoyed trying different types of bread, like red bean and almond bread. I also got to taste authentic Pad Thai noodles and Veg Thai Curry at a restaurant in True Digital Park. A fellow participant at the conference even taught me how to use chopsticks practically. I found Bangkok’s infrastructure very supportive for growth, with great workspaces and plenty of learning resources to help you make your own impact.

Through my talk, I highlighted the importance of Research Software in the research ecosystem, explaining why it is necessary to think about its sustainability. I shared methods, tools, and best practices that can be utilised to improve the sustainability of research software, following up with the need and the benefits to include techniques for reproducibility in Research Software. Furthermore, I shared what software tools can be used to create, maintain, and share research software (Zenodo, GitHub, GitLab). I spoke about the different types of licenses that can be attached to the outputs of the research. This was followed by a summary of the journey of the Research Software Engineering (RSE) Asia Association, which I co-founded and co-lead since its launch in 2021.\n🔑 Talk Resources:\nSlides: Jyoti Bhogal.

For the OSDWG session, which focused on topics like Open Science and how research software complements it, my presentation actually gave a keynote kind of a head start to the rest of the talks being presented in the session of OSDWG.\nSource: APAN58 : Asia Pacific Open and Sharing Data WG, 27th August 2024, Part 1\nTowards the end of my talk, I asked the audience to share their feedback to the questions ‘What do you think about research software engineering as a role and as a career path?’ and ‘What are your thoughts on how open science might help the researchers worldwide?’ and received some interesting responses:\n“Looks interesting, since I have heard about it for the very first time in this talk at APAN58 meeting.”\n“It is necessary for research software engineering management. I’ve heard that the organisations usually do not have enough capacity for managing research software engineers. However, they need software consistently. So, the public sectors help with this.”\n“It’s an innovative way to share research, data and publications, etc.”\n“So many students in the world have a very different situation in their social and life environment. For them, the internet and open science involving open access, open data, open software, and so on will help provide an education and research environment for equality.”\nIt was nice to see that my talk sparked curiosity in the audience and they promptly provided their feedback of what resonated with them. I also attended sessions on various topics including cybersecurity, high-performance computing \u0026amp; AI, agriculture and rural hybridization, network technologies, telemedicine and research collaborations. These sessions gave me more insights into the latest proceedings in the various fields of research and development in the Asia Pacific region.\nIn March 2025, I had the opportunity to speak at the Asia Pacific Advanced Network’s APAN59 meeting online remotely. My presentation was on the title ‘Building Bridges: Advancing Research Software Engineering and Open Science in Asia’. I gave my talk as part of the APAN’s Open and Sharing Data Working Group (OSDWG).

However, software testing is often overlooked, particularly in academic settings where researchers may lack formal training in programming best practices. This challenge was a central theme in the recent discussion during episode 5 of our six-part series “Enabling Open Science Through Research Code”, where experts from diverse backgrounds shared their experiences and insights on making software testing accessible and effective.\nDuring the session, panellists emphasised that while research software development is often self-taught, adopting best practices such as software testing can improve both individual efficiency and collaboration. One of the mantras that continuously came up in the different episodes is that\nWe should be our own best collaborators first.\nEpisode 5 once again showed how good coding practices can benefit the coder as much as other contributors, collaborators, and users. This post summarises the discussion, highlighting practical tips for beginners and more advanced strategies for experienced developers.\nOur wonderful speakers included:\nAbhishek Dasgupta, Senior Research Software Engineer at Oxford Research Software Engineering group, University of Oxford, UK Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal, Research Software Engineer at Imperial College London, UK and co-founder of the RSE Asia Association Sheena O’Connell, Software developer, founder and trainer at Prelude, South Africa Tips, Tools, and Practices for Novices If you’re new to coding or research software development, software testing may seem like an advanced topic. However, as our panellists suggest, starting with simple practices can make a big difference in the reliability of your code.\n1. Start with Assertions Assertions are a lightweight way to check that your code behaves as expected. Sheena shared an example from her experience, explaining how beginners often overlook errors that could easily be caught by using assert statements in Python. Assertions act as built-in sanity checks and can help catch errors early before they lead to misleading research results. 2. Use Smoke Testing Simply running your code from start to finish to ensure it doesn’t crash is an easy way to catch obvious issues. Sheena described this as a useful technique for those who may not yet have structured testing frameworks in place. Automated tools like nbval can help validate Jupyter Notebooks by checking that expected outputs remain consistent, an approach that Abhishek recommended. 3. Learn Basic Unit Testing Unit tests check individual functions or small sections of code. Abhishek stressed that even a simple test like assert 2 + 3 == 5 is a great first step. In Python, pytest is a lightweight and easy-to-use testing framework, whereas in R, testthat provides a simple way to implement tests within research code. 4. Keep Code Modular Writing functions instead of long scripts makes it easier to test individual components. As Sheena pointed out, “Untested code is brittle.” Structuring code into reusable functions makes adding tests more straightforward. 5. Automate Where Possible Using GitHub Actions or other Continuous Integration (CI) tools can automate testing whenever you update your code. Abhishek mentioned that CI is a great way to ensure code works across multiple platforms, which is particularly helpful when collaborating with researchers using different operating systems. For R users, the {usethis} package simplifies the workflow setup, automating repetitive tasks (for both R packages as well as non-package projects), as suggested by Saranjeet. She also recommended using the {fusen} package for anyone new to R package development (and also for experienced developers while they are prototyping functions) as it involves writing the function as well as its documentation and unit tests in the same file, avoiding the risk of forgetting crucial steps. Image Credits:Torsten Zelger\nApproaches to Software Testing for Experienced Developers For those already familiar with software development, a more structured approach to testing can improve reproducibility and collaboration. The panellists discussed key strategies for advanced users, including:\n1. Different Types of Testing Unit Testing: Ensures small, isolated parts of the code work as expected. Integration Testing: Checks if different parts of the system function correctly together. Abhishek highlighted the importance of this, noting that end-to-end validation is often overlooked in research projects. Regression Testing: Ensures new changes don’t break existing functionality, an approach Sheena described as essential for long-term code maintenance. Property-Based Testing: Uses tools like hypothesis in Python to test code with a range of inputs, uncovering unexpected behaviours. Abhishek noted this as particularly useful for numerical research software. 2.

It works brilliantly—but then, six months later, you revisit the code and… you’re lost. Sounds familiar? You’re not alone. Experts shared their experiences and strategies for writing good documentation in the fourth episode of the Research Software Community Conversations Series titled Enabling Open Science through Research Code. Here’s what we learned from our participants and insightful panellists:\nJenny Wong - Product Manager @ 2i2c (UK/US) Joel Nitta - Associate Professor @ Chiba University (Japan) Mthetho Sovara - Centre for High-Performance Computing (CHPC), National Integrated Cyberinfrastructure System (NICIS) CSIR (South Africa) 📌 Why Documentation is Essential 🚀 Boosts Reproducibility: Research software often accompanies papers, but results can be difficult to replicate without documentation. As Jenny pointed out, in fluid dynamics research, well-documented simulation codes gained more adoption than poorly documented alternatives.\n🤝 Facilitates Collaboration: Well-documented projects attract more contributors and streamline knowledge transfer. Joel shared his experience in the rOpenSci community, where clear documentation allowed him to take over and improve an existing R package without needing direct input from the original creator.\n⏳ Enhances Longevity: Code without documentation quickly becomes unusable—even by its original authors! Mthetho described how well-documented software in weather forecasting led to unexpected collaborations with the South African Weather Service and Ethiopian researchers.\n🔓 Promotes Open Science: Accessible research software fosters innovation and inclusion worldwide. Jenny emphasised that accessible documentation enables wider adoption of tools, making scientific computing more democratic.\n🔥 Common Challenges \u0026amp; Solutions ⏰ Time Constraints → Write minimal but clear documentation as you code. Joel suggested that legible code, such as meaningful variable names instead of “x” or “dat”, is itself a form of documentation that is even better than comments.\n🧩 Lack of Standardisation → Use templates and structured frameworks. Mthetho mentioned that clear, structured guides helped non-computational scientists successfully use OpenFOAM in unexpected fields like environmental science.\n🎯 Technical vs. User Documentation → Engage users in documentation efforts for clarity. Jenny highlighted the role of community-driven documentation efforts, such as hackathons, to improve usability.\n🛠 Best Practices for Better Documentation ✍️ 1. Write as You Code Waiting until the end leads to missing details. Add inline comments and README files while developing. Joel emphasised that tools like RMarkdown (and its successor, Quarto) can be used for literate programming—thereby ensuring that the results of code are automatically generated alongside their description.\n🔄 2. Differentiate Documentation Types ✔ User-facing documentation: How to install, use, and troubleshoot.\n✔ Developer-facing documentation: Comments, API references, contribution guides.\n📚 3. Use the Right Tools 📄 Markdown \u0026amp; Jupyter Notebooks – Combine narrative and code.\n📝 Quarto \u0026amp; R Markdown – For structured research outputs.\n📘 Sphinx \u0026amp; MIST – Python-based documentation frameworks.\n🌐 GitHub Wikis \u0026amp; Pages – Host documentation openly.\n🤖 AI-based tools (e.g., Cursor, Copilot) – Assist with documentation (but always review!).\n🤝 4.

This time, we focused on openly sharing research code. The conversation provided invaluable insights into best practices, challenges, and the impact of open source in research. Whether you are a researcher, software developer, or just getting started, here are the key takeaways from this inspiring discussion.\nWhy Open Research Code Matters Research software plays a crucial role in scientific discovery. Making it openly accessible enhances transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration. The discussion highlighted several reasons why open code can be beneficial to those who develop it as well as the broader research community:\nReproducibility \u0026amp; Credibility: When researchers share their code, others can validate and build upon it, ensuring scientific integrity. Collaboration \u0026amp; Community Growth: Open software enables researchers and developers worldwide to work together, improving tools and methodologies. Increased Citations \u0026amp; Impact: Studies with accessible code tend to receive more citations, increasing the visibility and influence of the research. Funding \u0026amp; Institutional Support: Many funding agencies now require researchers to share code and data as part of open science initiatives. Challenges and How to Overcome Them While making code open has clear benefits, it comes with its own set of challenges. Speakers shared personal experiences and solutions to common obstacles:\nFear of Criticism: Many researchers worry that sharing their code may invite scrutiny. However, constructive feedback leads to improved code quality. Maintaining Code Over Time: Researchers often move on to new projects and cannot maintain old code. One solution is to create a community around a project, inviting contributors to help maintain and improve it. Data Privacy \u0026amp; Intellectual Property: Researchers must anonymise datasets or create synthetic versions that simulate actual data while maintaining confidentiality when dealing with sensitive data. Documentation \u0026amp; Reusability: A well-documented project is far more valuable to others. Providing README files, usage instructions, and licensing information makes it easier for others to use and contribute. We talk more about documentation in Episode 4! Best Practices for Sharing Research Code To make code truly open and useful, researchers can consider the following best practices:\nUse Version Control Platforms: Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket facilitate collaboration, version tracking, and code sharing. Choose an Appropriate License: Open source licenses like MIT, Apache 2.0, and GPL define how others can use and modify the code. Provide Clear Documentation: A README file explaining installation, usage, dependencies, and citation details makes the code accessible to others. Include Citation Information: Using a CITATION.cff file ensures that researchers get credit for their work when their code is used in publications. Use Containerisation for Reproducibility: Tools like Docker and GitHub Code Spaces help ensure that code runs the same way on different machines. Leverage Community Support: Engaging with communities like Research Software Engineering (RSE) groups, The Carpentries, and others provides learning opportunities and networking. Diverse Perspectives on Open Science The discussion brought together speakers from various backgrounds, including bioinformatics, linguistics, software engineering, and illustration. Their stories emphasised that open science is not just for software developers but also for researchers and creatives working in different fields.\nAdeyinka Oresanya, a software developer at CHAOSS in Nigeria Chioma Onyido, a bioinformatician from Nigeria, shared how Bioconductor, an open-source project for bioinformatics, has been instrumental in her work. Mars Lee, a technical illustrator, highlighted the importance of visual documentation to make open source more accessible. Kate Huddlestone, a linguist at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, shared how open-source tools enabled her to work with sign language data, significantly advancing her research. Juan Pablo, a senior program manager at GitHub, discussed how GitHub provides tools like citation files and ORCID integration to make research software more discoverable and citable. Final Advice for Researchers Interested in Open Code Each speaker shared a key piece of advice for those looking to engage in open research software:\nJoin a Community: Engaging with open-source and research communities provides learning and collaboration opportunities. Take Small Steps: Even minimal documentation, a simple README, or choosing a license makes a big difference. Leverage Available Resources: Many educational institutions provide free access to GitHub tools and training programs. Don’t Fear Making Mistakes: Sharing imperfect code is better than keeping it inaccessible. The community will help improve it. …","date":1739836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1739836800,"objectID":"5b22dd11c62654060b6a7ef950dcd047","permalink":"https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/blog/2025-02-18-eostrc_ep_3/","publishdate":"2025-02-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/RSE_Asia/blog/2025-02-18-eostrc_ep_3/","section":"blog","summary":"This is a blog sharing insights from Episode 3 of the Community Conversation series 'Enabling Open Science Through Research Code'","tags":null,"title":"Enabling Open Science through Research Code: Insights from Episode 3 - Opening up Research Code","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Jyoti Bhogal, Mireille Grobbelaar, Anelda van der Walt, Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal"],"categories":["Research Software Engineering","Open Science","Coding","Community Building","Experience Blog","Software Testing"],"content":" This blog was originally hosted on the RSSE Africa webpage\nThe ‘Enabling Open Science Through Research Code’ meet-up series, co-hosted by RSSE Africa and RSE Asia, continues to build momentum. Episode 2, titled “Enabling Reproducibility Through Research Code,” took place on November 14, 2024, bringing together a diverse group of participants and experts to discuss a cornerstone of open science—reproducibility. A valuable open educational resource related to this topic, which the meetup was based on, is available from CodeRefinery.\nThe Turing Way Community. This illustration is created by Scriberia with The Turing Way community, used under a CC-BY 4.0 licence. DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3332807\nConnecting Researchers Who Code A key goal of this series is to connect researchers who code, especially those in Asia and Africa, with peers worldwide to foster collaboration and support. As **Anelda van der Walt (**RSSE Africa) explained:\n“There are so many researchers who code, but they’re often isolated and don’t have communities to share tools, best practices, or even just to vent about the challenges. We hope this series can be the starting point for those conversations.”\nWe welcomed participants from various disciplines, including health-related fields, law, linguistics, and bioinformatics. The audience represented a mix of coding-heavy researchers (spending over 50% of their day coding), less frequent coders, and those just beginning their coding journey.\nMeet the Panel Episode 2 featured a diverse panel of experts who brought their unique perspectives on enabling reproducibility:\nKozo Nishida: Project Researcher, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Japan Peter van Heusden: Bioinformatician, South African National Bioinformatics Institute/University of the Western Cape, South Africa Radovan Bast: Research Software Engineer, UiT The Arctic University of Norway, and managing the CodeRefinery project. Panel Discussion: Tips for Enabling Reproducibility Reproducibility, in its simplest terms, is about ensuring that research findings can be replicated and validated. Without reproducibility, there’s no way to confirm the reliability of scientific results.\nSaranjeet Kaur Bhogal, one of the session facilitators from RSE Asia, captured this sentiment perfectly when she said:\n“Be your own best collaborator.”\nThis idea resonated with all the panellists, who emphasised the importance of documenting workflows and code in a way that’s accessible and understandable—not just for others, but for your future self.\nRadovan Bast added to this perspective, explaining:\n“The person you will collaborate with most within your academic career is your past and future self. We should be kind to our future selves!”\nWhether six months or years down the line, thorough documentation and explanation of your work ensures you—or anyone else—can reproduce the results.\nKozo Nishida shared a practical example from metabolomics research, underlining the challenges of reproducibility in quantifying mass spectrometry data. He explained that creating annotations for mass spec peaks often requires manual tweaks and detailed adjustments. Without thorough documentation and clear steps, reproducing metabolomics quantifications becomes nearly impossible.\nPeter van Heusden reflected on his experiences entering the field of pathogen bioinformatics. He noted that many research papers described methodologies but often omitted critical details, highlighting the importance of reproducibility. He emphasised:\n“If it’s not in code, it’s not really reproducible.”\nFor Peter, reproducibility means translating what has been done manually into code, ensuring that workflows are transparent and repeatable.\nRadovan Bast pointed out that reproducibility encompasses many elements—data, scripts, dependencies, environments, workflows, and more. He acknowledged that achieving perfect reproducibility can be daunting and advised:\n“Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good enough.”\nRadovan reminded the audience that reproducibility doesn’t need to be flawless to be valuable. He emphasised the importance of sharing work in a reusable way to avoid reinventing the wheel or wasting time.\nPractical Tips for Ensuring Reproducibility The session provided many actionable tips to help researchers make their work more reproducible. These included advice on file types, documentation tools, and simple practices like running code on a different computer to ensure it works across environments.\nAs with all sessions in the series, a comprehensive resource sheet summarising these tips is available here.\nThe Importance of Community in Reproducibility The panel stressed how reproducibility benefits not just individual researchers but entire research communities:\nRadovan Bast stressed that limited time and resources make it essential to “stand on the shoulders of others” by building on existing tools and workflows rather than starting from scratch every time. However, he cautioned that when using …","date":1733270400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733270400,"objectID":"789895aa23ba4532555be1d3e8f4c92f","permalink":"https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/blog/2024-11-30-eostrc_ep_2/","publishdate":"2024-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/RSE_Asia/blog/2024-11-30-eostrc_ep_2/","section":"blog","summary":"This is a blog sharing insights from Episode 2 of the Community Conversation series 'Enabling Open Science Through Research Code'.","tags":null,"title":"Enabling Open Science Through Research Code: Insights from Episode 2 - Enabling Reproducibility through Research Code","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Jyoti Bhogal, Mireille Grobbelaar, Anelda van der Walt, Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal"],"categories":["Research Software Engineering","Open Science","Coding","Community Building","Experience Blog","Software Testing"],"content":" On October 10, 2024, the first episode of the ‘Enabling Open Science Through Research Code’ community conversation took place. The topic for the first episode was ‘Conversations with Researchers Who Code’ focusing on the pivotal role of research software in enabling open science. The event was hosted by RSSE Africa and the RSE Asia Association. It aimed to bring together researchers from various disciplines to share their experiences of coding, collaboration, and the challenges they face as they navigate the world of open science. This episode was a part of the celebration for International Research Software Engineer (RSE) Day, bringing attention to the growing importance of RSEs in research.\nSession Overview The session kicked off with facilitators Anelda van der Walt and Saranjeet Kaur welcoming participants and introducing the co-facilitators Jyoti Bhogal and Mireille Grobbelaar. This diverse team set the stage for a lively discussion with four distinguished speakers: Dr. Biandri Joubert, Dr. Gaurav Bhalerao, Mahmoud Abdelrazek, and Prasad Sutar. The session had around 30 participants from all across the world.\nIntroductions \u0026amp; Open Science Insights After a warm welcome, the conversation shifted to the core topic: open science and the importance of research software and systems as described in the UNESCO Open Science Recommendations. The facilitators invited the speakers to share their academic backgrounds, work experiences, and current roles, giving the audience a sense of the various pathways that lead them into the world of research software coding.\nSome of the key questions posed to the speakers included:\nWhat did you study, and where?\\ Do you have postgraduate qualifications?\\ What is your current role, and how does coding feature in your work? This introduction provided a backdrop to understand how the speakers’ careers evolved, and how their coding skills were developed to support their research or that of others at the organisation where they work.\nPanel Discussion: The Life of a Researcher Who Codes The heart of the session was a panel discussion where the speakers delved deeper into the realities of research coding. Some highlights from the discussion include:\nDr. Gaurav Bhalerao explained how coding forms an integral part of his day-to-day activities, particularly in structuring large datasets for neuroscience research. He also shared the challenges of balancing coding with research responsibilities.\\ Mahmoud Abdelrazek talked about his work in geospatial analysis and how his team collaborates on coding projects. He highlighted the collaborative nature of his work, where coding is not only a personal skill but also a shared responsibility within his research group.\\ Dr. Biandri Joubert touched on the challenges of being the sole programmer in her group and how she overcomes the feeling of isolation by participating in coding communities and seeking support from platforms like the Carpentries.\\ Prasad Sutar discussed his experience with developing software that is used by others and the importance of ensuring that his coding practices align with both the research objectives and software quality standards. The panel also explored whether all researchers should learn to code. They agreed that even if a researcher doesn’t need to code regularly, learning basic coding concepts is valuable. This foundational knowledge enables researchers to read and understand code at a high level, helping them grasp the algorithms or logic applied to address specific problem statements. A valuable analogy, comparing coding to medical training was suggested during the meetup. Just as it’s beneficial for everyone to learn basic first-aid, it’s useful for researchers to grasp fundamental coding concepts. Some may advance to become paramedics, equivalent to those using coding more regularly, while a few specialize deeply - similar to neurosurgeons or expert programmers. What are your thoughts? Should coding become a core skill for all researchers, or is it more practical to foster collaboration with coding specialists when needed?\nThe panel also explored topics like the amount of time spent coding, the collaborative nature of research software projects, and the availability of support and training for researchers.\nLearning and Community Support An essential part of the discussion revolved around the resources and communities that help researchers improve their coding skills. Dr. Gaurav Bhalerao recommended resources such as Carpentries lessons and online coding tutorials like p5.js for those starting out. The speakers emphasized the importance of continuous learning and staying connected with the global community through platforms like RLadies, Quarto, and others.

I experienced a diverse lineup, including keynotes, technical talks, hands-on workshops, lightning talks, poster sessions, and open forums (birds of feather (BoF) sessions). Sponsor stalls added to the excitement, and the open spaces allowed for spontaneous interactions, adding to the conference’s lively atmosphere. Celebrating its 15th anniversary this year, PyCon India 2024 marked my second time attending, following my first experience at PyCon India 2023 in Hyderabad.\nLightning Talks I had the opportunity to present a Lightning Talk titled “Accelerating India’s Open Science Journey with Python.” In my session, I introduced the audience to the concept of open science, highlighting its importance for India, exploring its four foundational pillars, and demonstrating how Python plays a vital role in advancing open science efforts. The talk was well-received, and you can view the slides on Zenodo.\nClick below to view video:\nKeynotes The conference featured four insightful keynotes:\nKovid Goyal presented “Making Python Programs Fast,” where he shared in-depth techniques to optimize Python performance using C language. Usha Rengaraju spoke on “AI for Autism,” shedding light on neurodiversity and the potential of AI in autism research. Mars Bar Lee explored “How Open-Source Opened My Opportunities,” highlighting how contributions to open-source projects can extend beyond code, such as her technical illustrations for NumPy. James Powell delivered a creative talk, “How Many Oranges?” Each keynote brought valuable perspectives, and Mars Bar Lee’s emphasis on non-code contributions was particularly interesting. I got to meet Mars in-person, after having met online previously for a workshop on importance of alt text with images for improving digital accessibility.\nWorkshops The first day had 3-hour workshops going on in three tracks. I attended two immersive workshops:\nChat with Tables: Developing Q\u0026amp;A system on Tabular data using Code Generative LLMs by Abhijeet Kumar\nAbhijeet conducted a workshop about Generative AI powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that are revolutionizing text, image, and video generation, as well as coding through enterprise solutions like GitHub Copilot, Google’s Gemini Code Assist, IBM’s Watsonx, and Amazon’s Q Developer. Abhijeet’s workshop focused on leveraging code-generating LLMs to enable non-technical users to generate Python code by using natural language queries, bridging the gap for business users who lack programming skills but need quick data insights. This solution is valuable for business users who often require ad-hoc analysis of tabular data but rely heavily on data teams. Abhijeet demonstrated a workflow to query tabular data, generate insights from CSVs, and enhance natural language querying (NLQ) through techniques like few-shot prompting, pruning, and validation. Additionally, the session included setting up a streamlined process for building Q\u0026amp;A systems for tabular data and creating a Streamlit app, making data insights more accessible to non-technical analysts.\nFrom Zero to Backend Hero: Creating Full-Featured Apps with FastAPI by Vivek Keshore\nVivek started by interacting with the audience to gather basic information like what an API is, the different types of APIs, and the various types of calls. Vivek discussed the benefits of using FastAPI. He went on to discuss database design. Vivek discussed about implementation of Pydantic models and the development of user management APIs.\nPyLadies Luncheon The PyLadies Luncheon was a personal highlight during the conference. Women attendees gathered to share their experiences, openly discussing the challenges they face related to diversity and inclusivity in their workplaces and how they’ve overcome these obstacles over time. Hearing these stories and learning about the resilience and strategies of others was truly inspiring and energizing for me.\nSponsor Stalls The conference featured several sponsor stalls, and one that stood out to me was the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an umbrella organization for retail payments and settlement systems in India. I was intrigued to learn how their payments ecosystem is entirely open-source, with data storage managed on-premises instead of on Cloud platforms. Additionally, they introduced me to UPI payments that can be made via phone call or SMS, allowing transactions without an internet connection.\nDevSprints The DevSprint was a one-day event featuring around 20 different projects. The day began with core contributors providing an overview of their respective projects, allowing participants to choose any project they were interested in contributing to. Among the various projects, I found myself particularly drawn to Django and NumPy.\nI opted to join the NumPy …","date":1729900800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1729900800,"objectID":"e9d5fe6172784ba94751564462fd1954","permalink":"https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/blog/2024-10-26_pycon_india_2024/","publishdate":"2024-10-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/RSE_Asia/blog/2024-10-26_pycon_india_2024/","section":"blog","summary":"Insights from the four-day annual Python conference.","tags":null,"title":"Insights from My Experience at PyCon India 2024","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Kozo Nishida"],"categories":["Research Software Engineering","Community Building","Unconference","Experience Blog"],"content":"What is the RSEAA Unconference? An unconference is a conference which is driven by the participants who engage in active discussions with optionally having presentations too.\nThe RSEAA 2022 unconference had a mixed style of regular conference and unconference. The regular style part had three keynote and a panel discussion. Recordings of the keynotes and panel discussion are available on YouTube.\nIn addition, it should be noted that the summary report is published at DOI (figshare) below.

(I was unable to watch Jess’s keynote live.)\nHere are my thoughts on Mars’s and Anne’s keynote.\nMars Lee Mars is a technical illustrator at Quansight.\nMars has a slightly different career path for RSE, and she introduced it in the keynote. I think Mars’ talk was a great talk that helped improve inclusivity of the RSE community. You can check the slides in this GitHub repo.\nAnne Steele Anne is a community manager of the Turing Way.\nAnne’s talk covered her career history, what she’s learned through her career and the projects she’s working on. Anne introduced the objectives of equality, diversity and inclusion in improving reproducibility and openness of research.\nIn Japan, where I live, there is no Community Manager for Open Science like Anne. So it was an exciting opportunity for me to know about this role.\nAbout the “Unconference” part The parts other than the keynote were held in an “Unconference” format. Here are the themes of the discussion that took place there.\nComputational Reproducibility Quantify RSE outputs Benchmarking domain-specific research workflow solutions at an international level Hosting research software Bridging the gap between biologists and programmers What exactly does the most senior RSE look like? Questions to ask your supervisor at your RSE performance review What would a secure RSE position look like? Let’s discuss employment realities, as a student, as a grad, as a postgrad, as an ECR RSE Silos Software as first-class outputs Justifying maintenance work A Web Platform for RSEs Actionable Items 1 - Community Building Actionable Items 2 - Peer programming and collaboration What are your thoughts on each of the above themes? Probably all of them are exactly what you(==RSE) want to discuss with someone. I was very impressed to learn that there are places (communities) in the world where people can discuss these themes.\n“Impressions about the RSEAA accessibility” and “a call for non-English-speaking RSEs participation” RSEAA 2022 had a great attention to accessibility. I am Japanese and I am not good at English. However, RSEAA 2022 had Zoom’s Live Transcription feature, so I had no trouble listening to English. Many Japanese can read English, but cannot listen or speak.\nRSEAA 2022 was well prepared on accessibility and Liz Hare provided a high level accessibility report for the conference. If you’re avoiding joining the RSE community because you’re not good at English, don’t be afraid. The RSE community is a community that cares about inclusiveness. Please feel free to join to the RSE community!\nFurther information about RSE and my gratitude for RSEAA organizaers If you are interested in the RSE community, please take a look at International RSE Survey 2022. It was released during this RSEAA 2022. I think that looking at the survey results will help us understand the current situation and think about the future.\nFinally, I would like to thank all the organizers for running RSEAA 2022.\nLearn More About Us For more information and to join upcoming events, visit:\nRSE Asia Website: https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/ For the latest news, events, activities, and opportunities, follow us on our LinkedIn page To join the RSE Asia community, please fill out our short Community Membership Form ","date":1729209600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1729209600,"objectID":"1e34d4f7a676b5e90b3c1d807acae860","permalink":"https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/blog/2022-10-01-rseaaexp22/","publishdate":"2024-10-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/RSE_Asia/blog/2022-10-01-rseaaexp22/","section":"blog","summary":"This is my experience note about RSE Asia Australia (RSEAA) Unconference 2022.

My mentor for the program was Malvika Sharan. There are several incidents when people want to contribute in a community activity, but the community does not have a well-defined path that will help a new person contribute. This motivated me to work on building pathways for new members to join the RSE Asia Association.\nThe Backstory The inception of RSE Asia Association goes back to September 2021, when our idea of starting it got the support of the experts from the OLS-4 cohort. Back then we started off with a basic logo. We had set up the entire digital structure need to run the community. During cohort 5, we updated the logo.\nMilestones the RSE Asia Association Crossed During OLS-5 Let’s have a look at the milestones in the journey that RSE Asia Association went through while OLS-5.\nMilestone 1 The selection into OLS-5 itself was a milestone. Following which, we started discussions around how to get our Association registered.\nWe wanted to register ourselves as an NGO. With the guidance from my mentor Malvika, I read several articles. I found out about the different types of NGOs that function here in India. After careful reading, understanding and discussions with my mentor, we finalized which type of NGO would be best for us to register as. At the moment, the registration is a work in progress.\nMilestone 2 When it comes to community work, we had identified that a lot of people are enthusiastic about participating in community work, however many communities face an issue when it comes to a smooth process for people to join them. Hence, we decided to define clear pathways for people to join us, to contribute/learn for a specific time duration.\nMilestone 3 The RSE Asia Association also got listed as an ‘Observer Association’ at the International Council of RSE Associations.\nMilestone 4 On 8th July 2022, we conducted a workshop, where Isabela Presedo-Floyd and Mars Lee very graciously accepted our invitation to share their knowledge of how alt-texts are written. It was indeed a very exciting and engaging event where people did hands-on work!\nNext steps Jyoti would continue with the formalities of getting the association registered legally. Saranjeet and Jyoti are planning to conduct more and more exciting events and workshops.\nStaying connected Come have a look at our activities! We are absolutely active on Twitter.

Online resource. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21201989.v2 キーノートスピーチに関する感想 RSEAA には3人のキーノートスピーチがありました。 私は Mars と Anne のスピーチをライブで聴講しました。 私は Jess のスピーチは仕事の都合でライブで聞くことはできませんでした。\nここでは Mars と Anne のキーノートに関する感想を述べます。\nMars Lee Mars は Quansight のテクニカルイラストレーターです。 Mars は RSE としては少し変わったキャリアパスの持ち主であり、彼女はそれをこのキーノートスピーチで紹介していました。 Mars のトークは、RSEコミュニティの包括性の向上に役立つすばらしいトークだったと思います。\nMars のスライドは、この GitHub リンク にあります。\nAnne Steele Anne は The Turing Way のコミュニティマネージャーです。 Anne のトークは彼女のキャリアの歴史、彼女が学んできたこと、そして今関わっているプロジェクトを紹介するものでした。 Anne は主に The Turing Way を通して再現性の改善や研究のオープン化において、平等、多様性、包括性といった目的をどのように実現しようとしているかを説明していました。 日本では Anne のようなオープンサイエンスコミュニティのためのコミュニティマネージャーはいません。 そのため、それは貴重な機会でした。\nアンカンファレンスのパートについて キーノート以外のパートはアンカンファレンス形式で行われました。 ここではそこで行われた議論のテーマを箇条書きします。\n計算の再現性について (Computational Reproducibility) RSE の成果の定量化について (Quantify RSE outputs) 国際レベルでのドメイン固有の研究ワークフローソリューションのベンチマーク (Benchmarking domain-specific research workflow solutions at an international level) 研究ソフトウェアのホスティングについて (Hosting research software) Biologists と Programmers のギャップを埋めることについて (#BridgingTheGap between #Biologists and #Programmers) 最上級の RSE とは正確にはどのようなものか? (What exactly does the most senior RSE look like?) RSE のパフォーマンスのレビューで上司に尋ねる質問 (Questions to ask your supervisor at your RSE performance review) 安全な RSE ポジションとはどのようなものか? (What would a secure RSE position look like?) 学生として、卒業生として、大学院生として、ECR [注: Early Career Researcher] として、雇用の現実について話し合おう (Let’s discuss employment realities, as a student, as a grad, as a postgrad, as an ECR) RSE の複数のサイロについて [注: サイロとはアプリやシステムが孤立し情報が連携されていないことを言います] (RSE Silos) 一流のアウトプットとしてのソフトウェアについて (Software as first-class outputs) 保守作業を正当化することについて [注: 研究ソフトウェア業界では保守に対する評価はされません] (Justifying maintenance work) RSE 達のためのウェブプラットフォームについて (A Web Platform for RSEs) 実行可能なアイテム1 - コミュニティの構築 (Actionable Items1 - Community Building) 実行可能なアイテム2 - Peer programming [注: 何らかの環境を複数人で共有してプログラミングすること] とコラボレーション (Actionable Items2 - Peer programming and collaboration) 上記の各テーマを見て、あなたはどう思われましたか？ おそらくどれも普段疑問に感じている、しかし身近に相談する人がいない、と思うことではないでしょうか？ それはまさに私も同じであり、このアンカンファレンスに参加して 「こういったテーマを議論できる場(コミュニティ)が世界には存在するのだ」ということを知り、感銘を受けました。\nアクセシビリティに関する印象と、非英語圏の RSE 達への参加の呼びかけ RSEAA はアクセシビリティに対する配慮が優れていました。 私は日本人であり英語が得意ではありません。 ですが RSEAA では Zoom の live transcription 機能が有効化されており、英語を聞きとることについては不自由がありませんでした。 日本人の多くはリーディングはできますが、リスニングとスピーキングができません。\nRSEAA はアクセシビリティについて十分に準備を整えており、Liz Hare は RSEAA のためにハイレベルなアクセシビリティレポートを提供しています。\n英語が苦手で RSE コミュニティへの参加を避けている場合でも、恐れる必要はありません。 RSE コミュニティは、包括性を重視するコミュニティです。 お気軽に RSE コミュニティに参加してください !\nRSE についてのさらなる情報と RSEAA のオーガナイザーへの感謝 ここまで読んでいただいて RSE コミュニティに興味を持っていただいた方は International RSE Survey 2022 をぜひご覧ください。 それはこの RSEAA の期間中に公開されたばかりです。 そのサーベイ結果を見ることは現状把握と今後を考えるのに役立つと思います。\n最後に、RSEAA を運営してくださった主催者の皆様に感謝いたします。\nLearn More About Us For more information and to join upcoming events, visit:\nRSE Asia Website: https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/ For the latest news, events, activities, and opportunities, follow us on our LinkedIn page To join the RSE Asia community, please fill out our short Community Membership Form ","date":1720569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1720569600,"objectID":"be71cc5e062f33138d00796fe07d7452","permalink":"https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/blog/2022-10-01-rseaaexp22-ja/","publishdate":"2024-07-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/RSE_Asia/blog/2022-10-01-rseaaexp22-ja/","section":"blog","summary":"これは、アジアオーストラリア地域で初めての RSE [注: Research Software Engineer の略] のカンファレンス (以降 RSEAA) の体験記です。 RSEAA は、2022 年 9 月 14 ～ 16 日に Zoom Events で開催されました。","tags":null,"title":"RSE Asia Australia Unconference 2022 体験記","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal"],"categories":["Research Software Engineering","National Research and Education Network","NREN","Community Building","Experience Blog"],"content":"This blog explores my thoughts on the potential role of National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) in promoting the growth of a Research Software Engineering (RSE) community in Asia-Pacific. The significance of this lies in the fact that NRENs have not traditionally been significantly involved in supporting RSE groups in other regions.\nAs I delved deeper into this topic, I learned that NRENs are specialised internet service providers designed to cater to the needs of research and education sectors in a particular region or country. These networks typically feature high-speed backbone connectivity and may provide dedicated channels for individual research initiatives. In the Asia-Pacific region, the Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN) is the international partnership of the NRENs that provides both domestic and international high-speed network connectivity.\nRSE Asia at APAN My interest in this topic grew during my participation in the Society of RSE pilot mentoring programme, where my mentor, Michelle Barker, introduced me to APAN. As a result, I attended the 53rd APAN meeting (APAN53), which was held virtually from March 7th to 11th, 2022.\nAt APAN53, I contributed to a panel discussion entitled “Accelerating the paradigm shift towards Open Science and Data Sharing in pandemic times and beyond” and presented the advancements of the RSE Asia Association. Additionally, I shared the narratives from RSE Asia Association at the workshop session titled “Growing research software initiatives and communities in the Asia Pacific.”\nHowever, it was at the 55th Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN55) meeting in Kathmandu, Nepal, where I had the opportunity to attend as a APAN55 Fellow, that I gained more knowledge about the NRENs in Asia. The Nepal NREN played an essential role in organising and hosting the event this year, and similarly, the Lanka Education and Research Network (LEARN), the Sri Lankan NREN, will be hosting and organising the upcoming APAN56 meeting.\nNational Research and Education Networks in Asia Afghanistan: Afghanistan NREN (AfgREN) Bangladesh: Bangladesh NREN (BdREN) China: China Science and Technology Network (CSTNET) China: China Education and Research Network (CERNET) Hong Kong: Hong Kong Academic and Research Network (HARNET) India: Education and Research Network of India (ERNET) India: National Knowledge Network (NKN) India Indonesia: Indonesia Research and Education Network (IdREN) Japan: Science Information Network (SINET) Japan Korea: Korea Advanced Research Network (KOREN) Korea: Korea Research Environment Open Network (KREONET) Malaysia: Malaysian Research and Education Network (MyREN) Nepal: Nepal Research and Education Network (NREN) Pakistan: Pakistan Education and Research Network (PERN) Philippines: Philippine Research , Education and Government Information Network (PREGINET) Singapore: Singapore Advanced Research and Education Network (SingAREN) Sri Lanka: Lanka Education and Research Network (LEARN) Taiwan: Taiwan Advanced Research and Education Network (TWAREN) Thailand: Thailand Education and Research Network (UniNet) Vietnam: Vietnam Research and Education Network (VinaREN) At APAN55, I presented the “RSE Asia Association: Journey and Future Plans” at the “Open and Sharing Data Working Group (OSDWG): Asia Pacific Open-Sharing Data and NRENs Open Science” session. Additionally, to promote the RSE Asia Association, I shared swag (sponsored by the Open Life Science programme). During the session, I also organised an activity in which participants were asked to share their ideas on Research Software Engineering (RSEng) as a career path and how open science could benefit researchers globally. I noticed several parallels between the duties and expertise of the staff at NRENs who develop research software infrastructure and those of RSEs while interacting with the attendees.\nIn a Twitter thread, I compiled responses from APAN55 participants regarding their opinions on RSEng as a profession and a career path. One person from Malaysia responded, “I think it’s an interesting path to choose especially for people who like to do research and also want to develop software”. An attendee from Nepal commented, “For me it’s a domain of software engineering”, while someone from South Korea observed that software has a significant impact in various domains. They stated that with software being integrated into almost every domain, there is a need for research to enhance its capabilities. Another participant from Nepal mentioned that they believed the role of RSEng to be important and its significance had grown over time. They further stated that the particular requirements of researchers could only be met by specialised software engineers who develop an understanding of the research ecosystem, have knowledge of existing solutions, and are capable of bridging any gaps that may exist. Quoting an attendee from India, “Indeed there could be a wonderful career for a software engineer in academia. …","date":1681689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681689600,"objectID":"37dcce3253205b93801fd4a15f008417","permalink":"https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/blog/2025-06-28-nren_rse/","publishdate":"2023-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/RSE_Asia/blog/2025-06-28-nren_rse/","section":"blog","summary":"This blog explores the author's thoughts on the potential role of National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) in promoting the growth of a Research Software Engineering (RSE) community in Asia-Pacific.","tags":null,"title":"Can National Research and Education Networks be a focal point for Research Software Engineers in some regions?","type":"blog"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/contact/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/RSE_Asia/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/RSE_Asia/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"RSE Asia was launched as a project in the cohort-4 of the OLS.\nThe Open Life Science (OLS) team planted a tree dedicated to its cohort-4 in the OLS forest.
