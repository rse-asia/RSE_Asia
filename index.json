His work focuses on topics related to software sustainability at the eScience Center, advancing its goal to empower researchers by collaboratively designing sustainable software, and building digital skills and expertise.\nColette Bos, Programme Director Netherlands eScience Center\nColette holds a PhD in research policy/research sociology and has extensive experience in research policy, research funding, impact of science evaluations and open science. She has worked at the Netherlands eScience Center for two years as Programme Director where she is responsible for the project portfolio of the center.\nGemma Turon Rodrigo, Executive Director, Ersilia Open Source Initiative\nTrained as a molecular biologist, Gemma completed a PhD in colorectal cancer and stem cells at IRB Barcelona in 2019, before taking a one-year break to focus on working and volunteering in the third sector. This shifted her scientific interest to global health and neglected diseases, and the existing barriers to tackle some of the most urgent health issues in developing countries. With Ersilia, she aims to explore new ways of community building and engagement in the scientific arena, at the intersection between academia, biotech start-ups and NPOs.\nJohn Chevers, Technology Lead, Data for Science and Health, Wellcome Trust\nJohn Chevers is Technology Lead in the Data for Science and Health Team at the Wellcome Trust. He has held leadership roles in industry, the NHS and academia, and has a particular interest in the funding and sustainability of software and data resources. Prior to working in the health sector, John led partnerships and commercial strategy for GEANT, the pan-European internet for research and education. He holds a PhD in Physics and an MSc in electrical engineering.\nJoseph Wafula, Professor and Lead, African Open Science Platform East Africa Node\nStay Connected Follow our LinkedIn page to get the latest updates about this series.\n","date":1742459400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1742459400,"objectID":"47cec4652068b46ce63bee73533d49cf","permalink":"https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/event/2025-03-20-ep-6-rs-fund/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/RSE_Asia/event/2025-03-20-ep-6-rs-fund/","section":"event","summary":"(Episode 6) Enabling Research Code through Open Science","tags":[],"title":"Funding for Research Software","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/contact/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/RSE_Asia/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/RSE_Asia/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"RSE Asia was launched as a project in the cohort-4 of the OLS.\nThe Open Life Science (OLS) team planted a tree dedicated to its cohort-4 in the OLS forest.
