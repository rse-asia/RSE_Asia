This was following my participation in the Collaborations Workshop 2025 organised by the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) at the University of Stirling. I was joined by SSI Fellows Samantha Wittke and Saranjeet Kaur.\nOn the day, Catherine Inglis and Neil Chue Hong welcomed us to the Bayes Centre at EPCC. The robots on the ground floor of the Bayes Centre are hard to miss, and I must say, I was captivated by them! We all went on a tour of the EPCC building and met several members of the team there. Later, we stepped out and had a lunch break in the beautiful and sunny campus of the University of Edinburgh. It was during the chats with Catherine and Neil, I got to know that the Unicorn 🦄 - an imaginary creature - is the National Animal of Scotland, and then it made sense to me why the buildings in Edinburgh have so many unicorn statues!\nThere were two talks planned for the day. The first one was by Samantha, who shared about the CodeRefinery project and her work with the Nordic RSE. Later, I presented my talk on the ongoing ‘Research Study on the Research Software Engineering (RSEng) Landscape in Asia’. Coincidentally, there were a few common points touched during both the talks - maybe CodeRefinery and RSE Asia could collaborate more closely in the future, but for now, I will focus this blog on my talk! 😊\nWhat is RSE Asia? We (I and my co-Founder Saranjeet Kaur) launched the Research Software Engineering Asia Association (RSE Asia) back in 2021, on the very first International RSE Day, as there was almost no awareness about Research Software Engineering in the Asian region. Over the past 3+ years we have conducted and participated in various events and workshops to raise awareness about the profession and the community. Based on the reflections over this period, I started to explore the RSE landscape in the Asian region to get better informed insights.\nWhat is my project about? The motivation for this project was gained after reflecting over several of the community initiatives and interactions that RSE Asia had with the community in the region. I was further encouraged to take this work ahead when I proposed the idea during my talk on ‘What is Research Software and Why Should we Think About its Sustainability?’ at the 58th meeting of the Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN58) during August 2024, which was attended by delegates from across Asia Pacific as well as the globe. I have been developing this idea since then, and have been encouraged and supported to do so by several RSE community members, SSI fellows, and community leaders.\nSpeaking of why this study is required - this study is essential for several reasons, some of which are the need to diversify and expand the research software landscape, attempt to address the lack of formal RSE roles in Asia, leverage international partnerships, and further build a supportive community within Asia.\nSSI has been conducting surveys to study the RSE landscape since 2018. However, there has been almost no representation of Asia in these surveys. This makes my research study even more essential.\nWithin Asia, the Asia-Pacific Advanced Network (APAN) is an organisation that represents member institutions as well as it is a backbone network connecting member countries and regions to each other and to other international research and education networks. I am a member of APAN’s Open and Sharing Data Working Group (OSDWG). This working group engages in dialogue and activities to promote good open science practices within research roles/institutes in the Asia Pacific. RSE Asia has had a consistent voice and representation during the biannual APAN meetings as a part of this working group. Through these engagements we realised the common interests we share with the working group and their intentions to help support the objectives of RSE Asia. Asia being a very complex and diverse region both, culturally and economically, it is essential to have the support from an established working group like the APAN’s OSDWG so as to have a better understanding of the research software landscape in the region.\nSo far in this project, I have been able to refine and adapt the existing SSI surveys to make them suitable for the Asian context. I have also launched a pilot survey with a small group in APAN’s OSDWG to gain first-hand feedback on the survey so far. Next, I plan to refine the survey further based on this feedback before launching the full survey to a larger group. If you are either a researcher based in Asia or have worked in the Asian region or collaborate with colleagues in Asia, then please watch the RSE Asia page for updates about my project and the survey - I would love to hear from you!\n🎉 Concluding the day After the talks, we spent some time discussing our work with the audience, which smoothly transitioned into EPCC’s ritual of ‘Friday …","date":1748476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1748476800,"objectID":"7c0cde165eeb6814436ce81f5784861c","permalink":"https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/blog/2025-05-27_epcc_talk/","publishdate":"2025-05-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/RSE_Asia/blog/2025-05-27_epcc_talk/","section":"blog","summary":"In this blog, I walk you through my visit to the EPCC, University of Edinburgh where I was invited for a talk for my work towards the RSE Asia Association!","tags":null,"title":"Halò Scotland!

The significance of this lies in the fact that NRENs have not traditionally been significantly involved in supporting RSE groups in other regions.\nAs I delved deeper into this topic, I learned that NRENs are specialised internet service providers designed to cater to the needs of research and education sectors in a particular region or country. These networks typically feature high-speed backbone connectivity and may provide dedicated channels for individual research initiatives. In the Asia-Pacific region, the Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN) is the international partnership of the NRENs that provides both domestic and international high-speed network connectivity.\nRSE Asia at APAN My interest in this topic grew during my participation in the Society of RSE pilot mentoring programme, where my mentor, Michelle Barker, introduced me to APAN. As a result, I attended the 53rd APAN meeting (APAN53), which was held virtually from March 7th to 11th, 2022.\nAt APAN53, I contributed to a panel discussion entitled “Accelerating the paradigm shift towards Open Science and Data Sharing in pandemic times and beyond” and presented the advancements of the RSE Asia Association. Additionally, I shared the narratives from RSE Asia Association at the workshop session titled “Growing research software initiatives and communities in the Asia Pacific.”\nHowever, it was at the 55th Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN55) meeting in Kathmandu, Nepal, where I had the opportunity to attend as a APAN55 Fellow, that I gained more knowledge about the NRENs in Asia. The Nepal NREN played an essential role in organising and hosting the event this year, and similarly, the Lanka Education and Research Network (LEARN), the Sri Lankan NREN, will be hosting and organising the upcoming APAN56 meeting.\nNational Research and Education Networks in Asia Afghanistan: Afghanistan NREN (AfgREN) Bangladesh: Bangladesh NREN (BdREN) China: China Science and Technology Network (CSTNET) China: China Education and Research Network (CERNET) Hong Kong: Hong Kong Academic and Research Network (HARNET) India: Education and Research Network of India (ERNET) India: National Knowledge Network (NKN) India Indonesia: Indonesia Research and Education Network (IdREN) Japan: Science Information Network (SINET) Japan Korea: Korea Advanced Research Network (KOREN) Korea: Korea Research Environment Open Network (KREONET) Malaysia: Malaysian Research and Education Network (MyREN) Nepal: Nepal Research and Education Network (NREN) Pakistan: Pakistan Education and Research Network (PERN) Philippines: Philippine Research , Education and Government Information Network (PREGINET) Singapore: Singapore Advanced Research and Education Network (SingAREN) Sri Lanka: Lanka Education and Research Network (LEARN) Taiwan: Taiwan Advanced Research and Education Network (TWAREN) Thailand: Thailand Education and Research Network (UniNet) Vietnam: Vietnam Research and Education Network (VinaREN) At APAN55, I presented the “RSE Asia Association: Journey and Future Plans” at the “Open and Sharing Data Working Group (OSDWG): Asia Pacific Open-Sharing Data and NRENs Open Science” session. Additionally, to promote the RSE Asia Association, I shared swag (sponsored by the Open Life Science programme). During the session, I also organised an activity in which participants were asked to share their ideas on Research Software Engineering (RSEng) as a career path and how open science could benefit researchers globally. I noticed several parallels between the duties and expertise of the staff at NRENs who develop research software infrastructure and those of RSEs while interacting with the attendees.\nIn a Twitter thread, I compiled responses from APAN55 participants regarding their opinions on RSEng as a profession and a career path. One person from Malaysia responded, “I think it’s an interesting path to choose especially for people who like to do research and also want to develop software”. An attendee from Nepal commented, “For me it’s a domain of software engineering”, while someone from South Korea observed that software has a significant impact in various domains. They stated that with software being integrated into almost every domain, there is a need for research to enhance its capabilities. Another participant from Nepal mentioned that they believed the role of RSEng to be important and its significance had grown over time. They further stated that the particular requirements of researchers could only be met by specialised software engineers who develop an understanding of the research ecosystem, have knowledge of existing solutions, and are capable of bridging any gaps that may exist. Quoting an attendee from India, “Indeed there could be a wonderful career for a software engineer in academia. …","date":1681689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681689600,"objectID":"37dcce3253205b93801fd4a15f008417","permalink":"https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/blog/2025-06-28-nren_rse/","publishdate":"2023-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/RSE_Asia/blog/2025-06-28-nren_rse/","section":"blog","summary":"This blog explores the author's thoughts on the potential role of National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) in promoting the growth of a Research Software Engineering (RSE) community in Asia-Pacific.","tags":null,"title":"Can National Research and Education Networks be a focal point for Research Software Engineers in some regions?","type":"blog"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/contact/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/RSE_Asia/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/RSE_Asia/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"RSE Asia was launched as a project in the cohort-4 of the OLS.\nThe Open Life Science (OLS) team planted a tree dedicated to its cohort-4 in the OLS forest.
