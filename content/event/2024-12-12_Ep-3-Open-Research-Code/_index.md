Are you ready to get some credit for the coding you’ve been doing as part of your research?

This episode will focus on ways to make your code contribute to your resumé. We will look at how you can share your code with the world (including various software licensing options), get persistent identifiers and make your code citable, and even how you can publish your code as an article!

**12 December 2024 @ 8:30 - 10:00 am UTC [see in your local time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20241212T0830&p1=1440&ah=1&am=30)**

  Software Developer, _Community Health Analytics in Open Source Software (CHAOSS)_ 
  
  Adeyinka Oresanya is a multidisciplinary software developer and open-source maintainer
  with a strong foundation in research. She holds a PhD in Agricultural Extension and Rural
  Development, combining a unique blend of academic rigour and practical software
  engineering skills to lead impactful projects. As the Badging Lead for the DEI Event
  Badging Program at CHAOSS, she plays a key role in advancing diversity, equity, and
  inclusion within open-source communities and events. Adeyinka also leads the CHAOSS Africa
  Developers’ Focus Group, where she drives initiatives aimed at fostering the growth of
  open-source developer communities across Africa.

- **[Chioma Onyido](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chioma-onyido/)**,
  Bioinformatics Engineer, _Bioconductor & Covenant University_
  
  Chioma is a seasoned biocurator and bioinformatician with a background in biochemistry,     who transitioned into Bioinformatics to explore how computational tools and data science    can solve real-world health challenges. Her work spans using Bioconductor and open-source   tools to analyze complex biological datasets and develop predictive models, aiming to       improve disease risk prediction for underrepresented populations. She enjoys making         research more accessible by creating well-documented, reproducible code and sharing         bioinformatics resources with the community.

- **[Dr Kate Huddlestone](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kate-Huddlestone)**,
  Senior Lecturer, _Department of General Linguistics, Stellenbosch University, South         Africa_
  
  I am a senior lecturer in the Department of General Linguistics at Stellenbosch             University, the managing editor for Stellenbosch Papers in Linguistics Plus (SPiL Plus)     and deputy chairperson for the Southern African Linguistics and Applied Linguistics         Society (SALALS). My research focuses primarily on South African Sign Language (SASL) but   I also work on aspects of the syntax and pragmatics of Afrikaans and South African          English. I use ELAN to annotate SASL data collected from deaf signers. I use R to analyse   the effect of linguistic and sociolinguistic variables on lexical variation, language       structure and language use.

- **[Mars Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mars-lee/)**,
  Technical Illustrator, _NumPy & Open Source Design_
  
  Mars Lee is a Technical Illustrator that makes byte-sized comics that explain technical     topics! She uses art, an under-represented skillset in open source, to get scientists       contributing. From contributing back to libraries they use, she hopes scientists share      their own research code and software. She is active in the Scientific Python space, with    contributions to NumPy, JupyterLab, scikit-learn and more. Her most recent works are the    ‘How to Contribute to NumPy’ comics - https://heyzine.com/flip-book/3e66a13901.html
