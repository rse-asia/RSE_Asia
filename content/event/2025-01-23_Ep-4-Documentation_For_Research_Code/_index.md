Do you dread writing documentation for the code you develop as part of your research projects?

This episode we will focus on the motivation for creating documentation for research code, different types of documentation, some small additions that can already make a world of difference to the usability of your code (for yourself and others!) for example, in-code comments and README files. We’ll also look at some more advanced documentation options.

**23 January 2025 @ 8:30 - 10:00 am UTC [(see in your local time)](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Documentation+for+Research+Code&iso=20250123T0830&p1=1440&ah=1&am=30)**

- **[Mthetho Vuyo Sovara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mthetho-sovara-3a939272/)**,
  Research Support Scientist, _DCentre for High Performance Computing (CHPC), National Integrated Cyberinfrastructure System (NICIS), South Africa_
  
  I am passionate about understanding ocean-atmosphere interactions in southern Africa. My research leverages advanced research software, computational models, and data science techniques powered by high-performance computing (HPC) to improve weather and climate forecasts, supporting climate policy and tackling environmental challenges. Additionally, I work to empower postgraduate students across southern Africa through training in coding, research software, and HPC optimization. My initiatives span from high school outreach programs to advanced university workshops, fostering technical expertise and innovation in climate and computational research. These efforts aim to build capacity and advance scientific understanding in the region.
