In the third episode of the series **‘Research Software and NRENs in Asia’**, we will focus on the changing role of libraries and information professionals in supporting research in software-intensive environments. Through an informal fireside chat, we will discuss how software and technical skills are becoming central to research support, how libraries are adapting to these changes, and how professionals can build confidence, capacity, and sustainable career pathways in this evolving landscape.

The session will explore themes such as skills development, mentorship, experimentation, leadership, and lifelong learning, with particular relevance to library staff supporting research and teaching across institutions in Asia.
