title: "Connecting Research Software to the Scholarly Record with DataCite"

event: Community Webinar with DataCite
event_url: https://example.org

location: Online

summary: Community Webinar with DataCite
abstract: DataCite’s vision is to connect research and advance knowledge by
  supporting more than 30 types of research outputs, resources, and
  activities - including code and research software. Through its open PID
  infrastructure and rich, open metadata, DataCite enables research software
  and code to receive DOIs, be persistently identified, and described with rich
  metadata. These outputs can be linked to related research objects such as
  datasets and articles, supporting open sharing, proper citation, and
  long-term discoverability. Together, these capabilities strengthen research
  visibility and contribute to a more connected research infrastructure. This
  webinar will provide an overview of the DataCite global community and
  services and showcase practical use cases related to research software.
