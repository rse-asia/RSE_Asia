This was following my participation in the &lt;a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/workshop/collaborations-workshop-2025-cw25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collaborations Workshop 2025&lt;/a> organised by the &lt;a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Software Sustainability Institute (SSI)&lt;/a> at the &lt;a href="https://www.stir.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Stirling&lt;/a>. I was joined by SSI Fellows &lt;strong>Samantha Wittke&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Saranjeet Kaur&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On the day, &lt;strong>Catherine Inglis&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Neil Chue Hong&lt;/strong> welcomed us to the &lt;a href="https://bayes-centre.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bayes Centre at EPCC&lt;/a>. The robots on the ground floor of the Bayes Centre are hard to miss, and I must say, I was captivated by them! We all went on a tour of the EPCC building and met several members of the team there. Later, we stepped out and had a lunch break in the beautiful and sunny campus of the University of Edinburgh. It was during the chats with Catherine and Neil, I got to know that the Unicorn 🦄 - an imaginary creature - is the National Animal of Scotland, and then it made sense to me why the buildings in Edinburgh have so many unicorn statues!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There were two talks planned for the day. The first one was by Samantha, who shared about the &lt;a href="https://coderefinery.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CodeRefinery&lt;/a> project and her work with the &lt;a href="https://nordic-rse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nordic RSE&lt;/a>. Later, I presented my talk on the ongoing ‘Research Study on the Research Software Engineering (RSEng) Landscape in Asia’. Coincidentally, there were a few common points touched during both the talks - maybe CodeRefinery and RSE Asia could collaborate more closely in the future, but for now, I will focus this blog on my talk! 😊&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="what-is-rse-asia">What is RSE Asia?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>We (I and my co-Founder &lt;strong>Saranjeet Kaur&lt;/strong>) launched the &lt;a href="https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research Software Engineering Asia Association (RSE Asia)&lt;/a> back in 2021, on the &lt;a href="https://researchsoftware.org/council/intl-rse-day.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very first International RSE Day&lt;/a>, as there was almost no awareness about Research Software Engineering in the Asian region. Over the past 3+ years we have conducted and participated in various events and workshops to raise awareness about the profession and the community. Based on the reflections over this period, I started to explore the RSE landscape in the Asian region to get better informed insights.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-is-my-project-about">What is my project about?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The motivation for this project was gained after reflecting over several of the community initiatives and interactions that RSE Asia had with the community in the region. I was further encouraged to take this work ahead when I proposed the idea during my talk on ‘&lt;a href="https://jyoti-bhogal.github.io/about-me/talks/2025-03-30_apan58/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What is Research Software and Why Should we Think About its Sustainability?&lt;/a>’ at the 58th meeting of the Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN58) during August 2024, which was attended by delegates from across Asia Pacific as well as the globe. I have been developing this idea since then, and have been encouraged and supported to do so by several RSE community members, SSI fellows, and community leaders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking of why this study is required - this study is essential for several reasons, some of which are the need to diversify and expand the research software landscape, attempt to address the lack of formal RSE roles in Asia, leverage international partnerships, and further build a supportive community within Asia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SSI has been conducting surveys to study the RSE landscape since 2018. However, there has been almost no representation of Asia in these surveys. This makes my research study even more essential.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within Asia, the Asia-Pacific Advanced Network (APAN) is an organisation that represents member institutions as well as it is a backbone network connecting member countries and regions to each other and to other international research and education networks. I am a member of APAN’s &lt;a href="https://apan.net/elements/working-groups/open-sharing-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open and Sharing Data Working Group (OSDWG)&lt;/a>. This working group engages in dialogue and activities to promote good open science practices within research roles/institutes in the Asia Pacific. RSE Asia has had a consistent voice and representation during the biannual APAN meetings as a part of this working group. Through these engagements we realised the common interests we share with the working group and their intentions to help support the objectives of RSE Asia. Asia being a very complex and diverse region both, culturally and economically, it is essential to have the support from an established working group like the APAN’s OSDWG so as to have a better understanding of the research software landscape in the region.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far in this project, I have been able to refine and adapt the existing SSI surveys to make them suitable for the Asian context. I have also launched a pilot survey with a small group in APAN’s OSDWG to gain first-hand feedback on the survey so far. Next, I plan to refine the survey further based on this feedback before launching the full survey to a larger group. If you are either a researcher based in Asia or have worked in the Asian region or collaborate with colleagues in Asia, then please watch the &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/rse-asia-association/?viewAsMember=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RSE Asia page&lt;/a> for updates about my project and the survey - I would love to hear from you!&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="-concluding-the-day">🎉 Concluding the day&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>After the talks, we spent some time discussing our work with the audience, which smoothly transitioned into EPCC’s ritual of ‘Friday Buns’. We discussed the challenges and way forward. Later that evening, I walked up the Calton hill (recommended by many) and got to see a 360° view of the city, the valleys, as well as the beautiful North Sea. Being a bright, sunny day, with the sun setting almost post 10 pm, I went for a walk to the Portobello Beach, and loved every bit of it!&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="-what-is-foss">🧑‍💻 What is FOSS?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>FOSS, an acronym for Free and Open Source Software, embodies a software development philosophy centered on freedom and openness. The term &amp;lsquo;Free&amp;rsquo; denotes users&amp;rsquo; liberty to run, alter, and share the software, while &amp;lsquo;Open Source&amp;rsquo; signifies that the software&amp;rsquo;s source code is available for users to inspect, modify, and contribute to its progress. FOSS promotes collaboration, transparency, and user empowerment. This frequently leads to the creation of more secure and sustainable software projects. Notable examples of FOSS include Linux, Blender, Chromium, Kubernetes, and Mozilla Firefox, among many more.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="-what-is-fossasia">🧑‍💻🌏 What is FOSSASIA?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://fossasia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FOSSASIA&lt;/a> is an organisation developing Open Source software applications and Open Hardware together with a global community from its base in Asia. Their goal is to provide access to open technologies, science applications and knowledge that improve people&amp;rsquo;s lives. They enable people to adapt and change technology according to their own ideas and needs, and validate science and knowledge through an Open Access approach. It was established in 2009 by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hongphucdang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hong Phuc Dang&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariobehling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Behling&lt;/a>. They organise and participate in conferences, meetups and code camps. The annual FOSSASIA Summit is one of the top tech events in Asia. FOSSASIA also runs a number of coding programs, such as &lt;a href="https://codeheat.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codeheat&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://eventyay.com/e/4c0e0c27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15th edition of FOSSASIA Summit&lt;/a> was organised at True Digital Park, Bangkok, Thailand from 13th to 15th March 2025. It brought together individuals sharing talks on topics around Free and Open Source Software. The Summit had multiple parallel track sessions like talks, lightning talks, workshops, and more! There were booths by various organisations creating and/or using Free and Open Source Software. This was my first experience of attending FOSSASIA in-person in Thailand.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="-day-1">🗓️ Day 1&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The day started with a lot of fervour. Following the welcome session by Hong Phuc Dang, there were multiple parallel tracks of talks. One of the booths demonstrated &lt;em>&lt;strong>Robot Jupiter&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> (image below) - an interactive virtual education assistant!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The second day of the summit, 14th March, was themed as PGDay 2025, a 1-day event focused on the PostgreSQL database, which was held in conjunction with the FOSSASIA Summit. I learnt about a new tool - &lt;a href="https://pgroll.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pgroll&lt;/a>. It is an open-source command-line tool designed for PostgreSQL, ensuring that schema updates are applied safely, without locking the database, and enabling multiple schema versions to coexist. This ensures uninterrupted operation for client applications during migration, even when introducing breaking changes. The tool’s capability to automatically backfill columns and support instant rollbacks further enhances its reliability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later that day, I came across the booth of &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/grafana-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grafana Labs&lt;/a>. As I spoke to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richih/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Hartmann&lt;/a>, he shared about the useful features of Grafana Labs tools for creating reports, metrics, and graphs about the code being written.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="-day-3">🗓️ Day 3&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I held a ‘&lt;em>&lt;strong>Meet &amp;amp; Greet Spot&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>’ to speak to people about the field of Research Software Engineering, and discussed how it is a career path where one can combine their interest in implementing their research skills along with programming skills. I also shared about the past and the upcoming activities of the &lt;a href="https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research Software Engineering (RSE) Asia Association&lt;/a>. Most people were curious to learn more about it, and also expressed a desire to join the future events held for the community.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>From the moment I arrived at the Suvarnabhumi airport, I found everyone to be warm and welcoming. People at help desks, metro ticket counters, and even local markets were kind and helped me get around the city easily. I also learned something new about Thailand — it&amp;rsquo;s a pedestrian-first country, where vehicles stop to let people cross the road. Another thing I noticed was a good gender balance in the different workplaces that I came across.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With fresh fruits like mangoes, jackfruits, bananas, guavas, cashews, and coconuts, I truly experienced the tropical feel of the country. I enjoyed trying different types of bread, like red bean and almond bread. I also got to taste authentic Pad Thai noodles and Veg Thai Curry at a restaurant in True Digital Park. A fellow participant at the conference even taught me how to use chopsticks practically. I found Bangkok’s infrastructure very supportive for growth, with great workspaces and plenty of learning resources to help you make your own impact. Everyone I met — from the conference team to the hotel staff — was friendly and helpful, making the city feel not just a hub to flourish businesses and communities, but a place that warmly welcomes you again and again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here’s a glimpse of Bangkok through my eyes!&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="-my-takeaway-">📕 My takeaway …&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>FOSSASIA Summit 2025 was especially close to my heart because it rekindled in me the spirit, zeal, and dedication towards contributing back to the software that we, knowingly or unknowingly, use on a day-to-day basis. As I left Thailand to return home, I carried so many learnings with me - especially the power that the voice of a community has!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that, I am concluding this blog until next time …&lt;/p>
