&lt;p>At the 60th meeting of the &lt;a href="https://apan60.apan.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN60)&lt;/a> in Hong Kong, the RSE Asia Association officially signed its first-ever Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the &lt;a href="https://apan.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN)&lt;/a>. At the signing, the RSE Asia Association was represented by our Co-Founder Jyoti Bhogal and the Asia Pacific Advanced Network was represented by the Chair of the APAN Board of Directors, Prof. Dr. Shinji Shimojo.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-apan">What is APAN?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN) is the international partnership of the National Research and Education Networks NRENs connecting communities across the Asia-Pacific region. APAN provides a platform for collaboration, knowledge sharing, and the development of advanced networking technologies to support research and education.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-does-this-mou-mean-for-rse-asia">What does this MoU mean for RSE Asia?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This collaboration marks an exciting step forward for our volunteer-driven community, committed to raising awareness and building capacity in research software engineering (RSE) across Asia. With APAN’s extensive network of research and education stakeholders primarily focused around the Asia-Pacific and RSE Asia’s growing grassroots community, this collaboration opens up new opportunities to support researchers and software engineers alike within the region.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="next-steps">Next steps&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The MoU outlines several key areas of collaboration between RSE Asia and APAN. We’re excited to begin this journey together and look forward to co-developing initiatives that benefit the research software engineering community in Asia!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On the day, &lt;strong>Catherine Inglis&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Neil Chue Hong&lt;/strong> welcomed us to the &lt;a href="https://bayes-centre.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bayes Centre at EPCC&lt;/a>. The robots on the ground floor of the Bayes Centre are hard to miss, and I must say, I was captivated by them! We all went on a tour of the EPCC building and met several members of the team there. Later, we stepped out and had a lunch break in the beautiful and sunny campus of the University of Edinburgh. It was during the chats with Catherine and Neil, I got to know that the Unicorn 🦄 - an imaginary creature - is the National Animal of Scotland, and then it made sense to me why the buildings in Edinburgh have so many unicorn statues!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There were two talks planned for the day. The first one was by Samantha, who shared about the &lt;a href="https://coderefinery.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CodeRefinery&lt;/a> project and her work with the &lt;a href="https://nordic-rse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nordic RSE&lt;/a>. Later, I presented my talk on the ongoing ‘Research Study on the Research Software Engineering (RSEng) Landscape in Asia’. Coincidentally, there were a few common points touched during both the talks - maybe CodeRefinery and RSE Asia could collaborate more closely in the future, but for now, I will focus this blog on my talk! 😊&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="what-is-rse-asia">What is RSE Asia?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>We (I and my co-Founder &lt;strong>Saranjeet Kaur&lt;/strong>) launched the &lt;a href="https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research Software Engineering Asia Association (RSE Asia)&lt;/a> back in 2021, on the &lt;a href="https://researchsoftware.org/council/intl-rse-day.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very first International RSE Day&lt;/a>, as there was almost no awareness about Research Software Engineering in the Asian region. Over the past 3+ years we have conducted and participated in various events and workshops to raise awareness about the profession and the community. Based on the reflections over this period, I started to explore the RSE landscape in the Asian region to get better informed insights.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-is-my-project-about">What is my project about?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The motivation for this project was gained after reflecting over several of the community initiatives and interactions that RSE Asia had with the community in the region. I was further encouraged to take this work ahead when I proposed the idea during my talk on ‘&lt;a href="https://jyoti-bhogal.github.io/about-me/talks/2025-03-30_apan58/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What is Research Software and Why Should we Think About its Sustainability?&lt;/a>’ at the 58th meeting of the Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN58) during August 2024, which was attended by delegates from across Asia Pacific as well as the globe. I have been developing this idea since then, and have been encouraged and supported to do so by several RSE community members, SSI fellows, and community leaders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking of why this study is required - this study is essential for several reasons, some of which are the need to diversify and expand the research software landscape, attempt to address the lack of formal RSE roles in Asia, leverage international partnerships, and further build a supportive community within Asia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SSI has been conducting surveys to study the RSE landscape since 2018. However, there has been almost no representation of Asia in these surveys. This makes my research study even more essential.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within Asia, the Asia-Pacific Advanced Network (APAN) is an organisation that represents member institutions as well as it is a backbone network connecting member countries and regions to each other and to other international research and education networks. I am a member of APAN’s &lt;a href="https://apan.net/elements/working-groups/open-sharing-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open and Sharing Data Working Group (OSDWG)&lt;/a>. This working group engages in dialogue and activities to promote good open science practices within research roles/institutes in the Asia Pacific. RSE Asia has had a consistent voice and representation during the biannual APAN meetings as a part of this working group. Through these engagements we realised the common interests we share with the working group and their intentions to help support the objectives of RSE Asia. Asia being a very complex and diverse region both, culturally and economically, it is essential to have the support from an established working group like the APAN’s OSDWG so as to have a better understanding of the research software landscape in the region.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far in this project, I have been able to refine and adapt the existing SSI surveys to make them suitable for the Asian context. I have also launched a pilot survey with a small group in APAN’s OSDWG to gain first-hand feedback on the survey so far. Next, I plan to refine the survey further based on this feedback before launching the full survey to a larger group. If you are either a researcher based in Asia or have worked in the Asian region or collaborate with colleagues in Asia, then please watch the &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/rse-asia-association/?viewAsMember=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RSE Asia page&lt;/a> for updates about my project and the survey - I would love to hear from you!&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="-concluding-the-day">🎉 Concluding the day&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>After the talks, we spent some time discussing our work with the audience, which smoothly transitioned into EPCC’s ritual of ‘Friday Buns’. We discussed the challenges and way forward. Later that evening, I walked up the Calton hill (recommended by many) and got to see a 360° view of the city, the valleys, as well as the beautiful North Sea. Being a bright, sunny day, with the sun setting almost post 10 pm, I went for a walk to the Portobello Beach, and loved every bit of it!&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="-what-is-foss">🧑‍💻 What is FOSS?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>FOSS, an acronym for Free and Open Source Software, embodies a software development philosophy centered on freedom and openness. The term &amp;lsquo;Free&amp;rsquo; denotes users&amp;rsquo; liberty to run, alter, and share the software, while &amp;lsquo;Open Source&amp;rsquo; signifies that the software&amp;rsquo;s source code is available for users to inspect, modify, and contribute to its progress. FOSS promotes collaboration, transparency, and user empowerment. This frequently leads to the creation of more secure and sustainable software projects. Notable examples of FOSS include Linux, Blender, Chromium, Kubernetes, and Mozilla Firefox, among many more.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="-what-is-fossasia">🧑‍💻🌏 What is FOSSASIA?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://fossasia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FOSSASIA&lt;/a> is an organisation developing Open Source software applications and Open Hardware together with a global community from its base in Asia. Their goal is to provide access to open technologies, science applications and knowledge that improve people&amp;rsquo;s lives. They enable people to adapt and change technology according to their own ideas and needs, and validate science and knowledge through an Open Access approach. It was established in 2009 by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hongphucdang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hong Phuc Dang&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariobehling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Behling&lt;/a>. They organise and participate in conferences, meetups and code camps. The annual FOSSASIA Summit is one of the top tech events in Asia. FOSSASIA also runs a number of coding programs, such as &lt;a href="https://codeheat.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codeheat&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://eventyay.com/e/4c0e0c27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15th edition of FOSSASIA Summit&lt;/a> was organised at True Digital Park, Bangkok, Thailand from 13th to 15th March 2025. It brought together individuals sharing talks on topics around Free and Open Source Software. The Summit had multiple parallel track sessions like talks, lightning talks, workshops, and more! There were booths by various organisations creating and/or using Free and Open Source Software. This was my first experience of attending FOSSASIA in-person in Thailand.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="-day-1">🗓️ Day 1&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The day started with a lot of fervour. Following the welcome session by Hong Phuc Dang, there were multiple parallel tracks of talks. One of the booths demonstrated &lt;em>&lt;strong>Robot Jupiter&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> (image below) - an interactive virtual education assistant!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I had a chance to speak to Nancy Reyes, a representative from the &lt;a href="https://www.a11ylab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A11y Accessibility Labs&lt;/a>. She was showcasing the hardware items that they use for digital accessibility awareness training during their Usability and Accessibility Clinic sessions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The second day of the summit, 14th March, was themed as PGDay 2025, a 1-day event focused on the PostgreSQL database, which was held in conjunction with the FOSSASIA Summit. I learnt about a new tool - &lt;a href="https://pgroll.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pgroll&lt;/a>. It is an open-source command-line tool designed for PostgreSQL, ensuring that schema updates are applied safely, without locking the database, and enabling multiple schema versions to coexist. This ensures uninterrupted operation for client applications during migration, even when introducing breaking changes. The tool’s capability to automatically backfill columns and support instant rollbacks further enhances its reliability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later that day, I came across the booth of &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/grafana-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grafana Labs&lt;/a>. As I spoke to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richih/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Hartmann&lt;/a>, he shared about the useful features of Grafana Labs tools for creating reports, metrics, and graphs about the code being written.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="-day-3">🗓️ Day 3&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I held a ‘&lt;em>&lt;strong>Meet &amp;amp; Greet Spot&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>’ to speak to people about the field of Research Software Engineering, and discussed how it is a career path where one can combine their interest in implementing their research skills along with programming skills. I also shared about the past and the upcoming activities of the &lt;a href="https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research Software Engineering (RSE) Asia Association&lt;/a>. Most people were curious to learn more about it, and also expressed a desire to join the future events held for the community.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>From the moment I arrived at the Suvarnabhumi airport, I found everyone to be warm and welcoming. People at help desks, metro ticket counters, and even local markets were kind and helped me get around the city easily. I also learned something new about Thailand — it&amp;rsquo;s a pedestrian-first country, where vehicles stop to let people cross the road. Another thing I noticed was a good gender balance in the different workplaces that I came across.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With fresh fruits like mangoes, jackfruits, bananas, guavas, cashews, and coconuts, I truly experienced the tropical feel of the country. I enjoyed trying different types of bread, like red bean and almond bread. I also got to taste authentic Pad Thai noodles and Veg Thai Curry at a restaurant in True Digital Park. A fellow participant at the conference even taught me how to use chopsticks practically. I found Bangkok’s infrastructure very supportive for growth, with great workspaces and plenty of learning resources to help you make your own impact. Everyone I met — from the conference team to the hotel staff — was friendly and helpful, making the city feel not just a hub to flourish businesses and communities, but a place that warmly welcomes you again and again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here’s a glimpse of Bangkok through my eyes!&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="-my-takeaway-">📕 My takeaway …&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>FOSSASIA Summit 2025 was especially close to my heart because it rekindled in me the spirit, zeal, and dedication towards contributing back to the software that we, knowingly or unknowingly, use on a day-to-day basis. As I left Thailand to return home, I carried so many learnings with me - especially the power that the voice of a community has!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that, I am concluding this blog until next time …&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>What is the Asia-Pacific Advanced Network (APAN)?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>APAN is the international partnership of the National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) across the Asia Pacific region. It spans over half of the world’s population, and its members are fundamental in the provision of high-speed network connectivity domestically and globally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>APAN has a number of working groups, one of which is the Open and Sharing Data Working Group (OSDWG). I became a member of this working group based on the common interest around developing the research software community and its importance in the research ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>APAN organises biannual meetings bringing together its members and other interested participants to review progress, demonstrate advances in technology and applications, and make plans for the future activities in the Asia Pacific. Over the past months, I got the chance to attend APAN58 and APAN59 meetings, online remotely and exchange knowledge with its stakeholders. In this blog, I am capturing my experiences of attending these meetings.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>During the APAN58 meeting (August 2024), I had the opportunity to present my talk titled &lt;em>&lt;strong>‘What is Research Software and Why Should we Think About its Sustainability?’&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> as part of the Open and Sharing Data Working Group (OSDWG) discussion session. Through my talk, I highlighted the importance of Research Software in the research ecosystem, explaining why it is necessary to think about its sustainability. I shared methods, tools, and best practices that can be utilised to improve the sustainability of research software, following up with the need and the benefits to include techniques for reproducibility in Research Software. Furthermore, I shared what software tools can be used to create, maintain, and share research software (Zenodo, GitHub, GitLab). I spoke about the different types of licenses that can be attached to the outputs of the research. This was followed by a summary of the journey of the &lt;a href="https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research Software Engineering (RSE) Asia Association&lt;/a>, which I co-founded and co-lead since its launch in 2021.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As I spoke about research software, its definition, the tools to write and maintain it, the audience became curious to know more about research software and the community around it. For the OSDWG session, which focused on topics like Open Science and how research software complements it, my presentation actually gave a keynote kind of a head start to the rest of the talks being presented in the session of OSDWG.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Towards the end of my talk, I asked the audience to share their feedback to the questions ‘What do you think about research software engineering as a role and as a career path?’ and ‘What are your thoughts on how open science might help the researchers worldwide?’ and received some interesting responses:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Looks interesting, since I have heard about it for the very first time in this talk at APAN58 meeting.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“It is necessary for research software engineering management. I’ve heard that the organisations usually do not have enough capacity for managing research software engineers. However, they need software consistently. So, the public sectors help with this.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“It&amp;rsquo;s an innovative way to share research, data and publications, etc.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“So many students in the world have a very different situation in their social and life environment. For them, the internet and open science involving open access, open data, open software, and so on will help provide an education and research environment for equality.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It was nice to see that my talk sparked curiosity in the audience and they promptly provided their feedback of what resonated with them. I also attended sessions on various topics including cybersecurity, high-performance computing &amp;amp; AI, agriculture and rural hybridization, network technologies, telemedicine and research collaborations. These sessions gave me more insights into the latest proceedings in the various fields of research and development in the Asia Pacific region.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In March 2025, I had the opportunity to speak at the &lt;strong>Asia Pacific Advanced Network’s APAN59 meeting&lt;/strong> online remotely. My presentation was on the title &lt;em>&lt;strong>‘Building Bridges: Advancing Research Software Engineering and Open Science in Asia’&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>. I gave my talk as part of the APAN’s Open and Sharing Data Working Group (OSDWG). Software being one of the pillars of Open Science, through this talk, I highlighted how paying attention towards developing and maintaining research software is directly linked to the principles of Open Science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later in March 2025, I had the opportunity to present my talk titled &lt;em>&lt;strong>‘Building Bridges: Advancing Research Software Engineering and Open Science in Asia’&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> at &lt;strong>APAN59,&lt;/strong> online remotely again as part of the OSDWG discussion session. Software being one of the pillars of Open Science, through this talk, I highlighted how paying attention towards developing and maintaining research software is directly linked to the principles of Open Science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During my talk, I shared about my ongoing &lt;strong>Research Study on the Research Software Engineering (RSEng) Landscape in Asia&lt;/strong>. I discussed the need of this study - due to the &lt;strong>no/low representation of the community of researchers who code in the Asian region&lt;/strong>. This is demonstrated by the outcomes of an existing global survey by the Software Sustainability Institute, which completely lacks representation from Asia.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I shared the roadmap of my research study with the audience. At the end of my talk, there were quite a few engaging questions. One of the comments from an active member of the APAN biannual meetings was&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“The topic of this research study is something that deals with a national-level problem, thus making it much more essential to be studied.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The appreciative feedback encourages me to keep taking my research work further.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">&lt;strong>Introduction&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the world of research software development, &lt;strong>ensuring that code runs correctly and produces reliable results is crucial&lt;/strong>. However, &lt;strong>software testing is often overlooked,&lt;/strong> particularly in academic settings where researchers may lack formal training in programming best practices. This challenge was a central theme in the recent discussion during episode 5 of our six-part series &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Enabling Open Science Through Research Code&amp;rdquo;,&lt;/em> where experts from diverse backgrounds shared their experiences and insights on making software testing accessible and effective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the session, panellists emphasised that while research software development is often self-taught, adopting best practices such as software testing can improve both individual efficiency and collaboration. One of the mantras that continuously came up in the different episodes is that&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We should be our own best collaborators first.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Episode 5 once again showed how &lt;em>good coding practices can benefit the coder as much as other contributors, collaborators, and users&lt;/em>. This post summarises the discussion, highlighting practical tips for beginners and more advanced strategies for experienced developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our wonderful speakers included:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4420-0656" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abhishek Dasgupta&lt;/a>, Senior Research Software Engineer at Oxford Research Software Engineering group, University of Oxford, UK&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saranjeet-k-48ab769b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal&lt;/a>, Research Software Engineer at Imperial College London, UK and co-founder of the RSE Asia Association&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheena-o-connell-0bb72527/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sheena O&amp;rsquo;Connell&lt;/a>, Software developer, founder and trainer at Prelude, South Africa&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="tips-tools-and-practices-for-novices">&lt;strong>Tips, Tools, and Practices for Novices&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re new to coding or research software development, software testing may seem like an advanced topic. However, as our panellists suggest, starting with simple practices can make a big difference in the reliability of your code.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="1-start-with-assertions">&lt;strong>1. Start with Assertions&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Assertions are a lightweight way to check that your code behaves as expected. Sheena shared an example from her experience, explaining how beginners often overlook errors that could easily be caught by using &lt;code>assert&lt;/code> statements in Python.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Assertions act as built-in sanity checks and can help catch errors early before they lead to misleading research results.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="2-use-smoke-testing">&lt;strong>2. Use Smoke Testing&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Simply running your code from start to finish to ensure it doesn’t crash is an easy way to catch obvious issues. Sheena described this as a useful technique for those who may not yet have structured testing frameworks in place.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Automated tools like &lt;code>nbval&lt;/code> can help validate Jupyter Notebooks by checking that expected outputs remain consistent, an approach that Abhishek recommended.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="3-learn-basic-unit-testing">&lt;strong>3. Learn Basic Unit Testing&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Unit tests check individual functions or small sections of code. Abhishek stressed that even a simple test like &lt;code>assert 2 + 3 == 5&lt;/code> is a great first step.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Python, &lt;code>pytest&lt;/code> is a lightweight and easy-to-use testing framework, whereas in R, &lt;code>testthat&lt;/code> provides a simple way to implement tests within research code.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="4-keep-code-modular">&lt;strong>4. Keep Code Modular&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Writing functions instead of long scripts makes it easier to test individual components. As Sheena pointed out, “Untested code is brittle.” Structuring code into reusable functions makes adding tests more straightforward.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="5-automate-where-possible">&lt;strong>5. Automate Where Possible&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Using GitHub Actions or other Continuous Integration (CI) tools can automate testing whenever you update your code. Abhishek mentioned that CI is a great way to ensure code works across multiple platforms, which is particularly helpful when collaborating with researchers using different operating systems.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For R users, the {&lt;code>usethis}&lt;/code> package simplifies the workflow setup, automating repetitive tasks (for both R packages as well as non-package projects), as suggested by Saranjeet. She also recommended using the {&lt;code>fusen}&lt;/code> package for anyone new to R package development (and also for experienced developers while they are prototyping functions) as it involves writing the function as well as its documentation and unit tests in the same file, avoiding the risk of forgetting crucial steps.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h2 id="approaches-to-software-testing-for-experienced-developers">&lt;strong>Approaches to Software Testing for Experienced Developers&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For those already familiar with software development, a more structured approach to testing can improve reproducibility and collaboration. The panellists discussed key strategies for advanced users, including:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="1-different-types-of-testing">&lt;strong>1. Different Types of Testing&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Unit Testing&lt;/strong>: Ensures small, isolated parts of the code work as expected.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Integration Testing&lt;/strong>: Checks if different parts of the system function correctly together. Abhishek highlighted the importance of this, noting that end-to-end validation is often overlooked in research projects.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Regression Testing&lt;/strong>: Ensures new changes don’t break existing functionality, an approach Sheena described as essential for long-term code maintenance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Property-Based Testing&lt;/strong>: Uses tools like &lt;code>hypothesis&lt;/code> in Python to test code with a range of inputs, uncovering unexpected behaviours. Abhishek noted this as particularly useful for numerical research software.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="2-version-control-and-cicd">&lt;strong>2. Version Control and CI/CD&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Git and GitHub/GitLab&lt;/strong>: Version control helps track changes, making it easier to debug issues. Sheena emphasised that &amp;ldquo;researchers who don&amp;rsquo;t use version control end up with folders full of files like &lt;code>final_version_revised_final_final.py&lt;/code>, which is a nightmare to maintain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Continuous Integration (CI)&lt;/strong>: Running tests automatically on GitHub ensures all code changes are validated before being merged. Abhishek explained that setting up CI allows researchers to avoid relying on manual testing across different machines.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="3-cross-platform-testing">&lt;strong>3. Cross-Platform Testing&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Researchers often work across different operating systems. Automating tests in cloud environments ensures compatibility with Windows, macOS, and Linux.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tools like &lt;code>tox&lt;/code> or &lt;code>nox&lt;/code> (Python) allow testing across multiple versions of a language. Abhishek highlighted that CI workflows, once set up, eliminate the need to manually ask colleagues to test code on different platforms.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="4-automating-data-validations">&lt;strong>4. Automating Data Validations&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Data quality is critical in research. Sheena introduced &lt;code>pandera&lt;/code> in Python, a tool that helps verify data integrity and data schemas before analysis.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Statistical validation using libraries like &lt;code>scipy.stats&lt;/code> can confirm that distributions match expected properties, an approach recommended for data-intensive projects.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="5-balancing-testing-with-research-deadlines">&lt;strong>5. Balancing Testing with Research Deadlines&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Writing tests may seem like extra work, but it prevents time-consuming debugging later. Abhishek acknowledged that &amp;ldquo;getting 100% test coverage is impractical for most research projects, but basic integration tests should be a minimum.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using automated tools like R’s &lt;code>targets&lt;/code> package helps manage computational workflows efficiently, only re-running necessary parts of the code. Saranjeet recommended this as a time-saving approach for researchers handling large datasets.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">&lt;strong>Conclusion&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Software testing is not just for professional developers—it is an essential practice for research reproducibility and collaboration. While beginners can start with simple assertions and unit tests, advanced users can implement continuous integration, property-based testing, and automated data validation to ensure code reliability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As Anelda concluded,&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Testing is not just about making research more open; it’s about being your own best &amp;gt; collaborator.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>By integrating these testing strategies into research software development, we can move toward a more open, transparent, and reliable scientific ecosystem.&lt;/p>

The significance of this lies in the fact that NRENs have not traditionally been significantly involved in supporting RSE groups in other regions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I delved deeper into this topic, I learned that NRENs are specialised internet service providers designed to cater to the needs of research and education sectors in a particular region or country. These networks typically feature high-speed backbone connectivity and may provide dedicated channels for individual research initiatives. In the Asia-Pacific region, the &lt;a href="https://apan.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN)&lt;/a> is the international partnership of the NRENs that provides both domestic and international high-speed network connectivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rse-asia-at-apan">RSE Asia at APAN&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My interest in this topic grew during my participation in the &lt;a href="https://society-rse.org/events/pilot-mentoring-programme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Society of RSE pilot mentoring programme&lt;/a>, where my mentor, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelledbarker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michelle Barker&lt;/a>, introduced me to APAN. As a result, I attended the &lt;a href="https://apan53.apan.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">53rd APAN meeting (APAN53)&lt;/a>, which was held virtually from March 7th to 11th, 2022.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At APAN53, I contributed to a panel discussion entitled &amp;ldquo;Accelerating the paradigm shift towards Open Science and Data Sharing in pandemic times and beyond&amp;rdquo; and presented the &lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/record/7698570#.ZDV0Hi8Rp-U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advancements of the RSE Asia Association&lt;/a>. Additionally, I shared the &lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/record/7698591#.ZDV0Uy8Rp-U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narratives from RSE Asia Association&lt;/a> at the workshop session titled &amp;ldquo;Growing research software initiatives and communities in the Asia Pacific.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, it was at the &lt;a href="https://apan55.apan.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55th Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN55)&lt;/a> meeting in Kathmandu, Nepal, where I had the opportunity to attend as a &lt;a href="http://apan.net/fellowship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APAN55 Fellow&lt;/a>, that I gained more knowledge about the &lt;a href="#national-research-and-education-networks-in-asia">NRENs in Asia&lt;/a>. The &lt;a href="https://www.nren.net.np" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nepal NREN&lt;/a> played an essential role in organising and hosting the event this year, and similarly, the &lt;a href="https://www.ac.lk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lanka Education and Research Network (LEARN)&lt;/a>, the Sri Lankan NREN, will be hosting and organising the upcoming APAN56 meeting.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>At APAN55, I presented the &lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/record/7817687" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;RSE Asia Association: Journey and Future Plans&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> at the “Open and Sharing Data Working Group (OSDWG): Asia Pacific Open-Sharing Data and NRENs Open Science” session. Additionally, to promote the RSE Asia Association, I shared swag (sponsored by the &lt;a href="https://openlifesci.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Life Science&lt;/a> programme). During the session, I also organised an activity in which participants were asked to share their ideas on Research Software Engineering (RSEng) as a career path and how open science could benefit researchers globally. I noticed several parallels between the duties and expertise of the staff at NRENs who develop research software infrastructure and those of RSEs while interacting with the attendees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RSE_Asia/status/1635942735948414978?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter thread&lt;/a>, I compiled responses from APAN55 participants regarding their opinions on RSEng as a profession and a career path. One person from Malaysia responded, &amp;ldquo;I think it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting path to choose especially for people who like to do research and also want to develop software&amp;rdquo;. An attendee from Nepal commented, &amp;ldquo;For me it&amp;rsquo;s a domain of software engineering”, while someone from South Korea observed that software has a significant impact in various domains. They stated that with software being integrated into almost every domain, there is a need for research to enhance its capabilities. Another participant from Nepal mentioned that they believed the role of RSEng to be important and its significance had grown over time. They further stated that the particular requirements of researchers could only be met by specialised software engineers who develop an understanding of the research ecosystem, have knowledge of existing solutions, and are capable of bridging any gaps that may exist. Quoting an attendee from India, &amp;ldquo;Indeed there could be a wonderful career for a software engineer in academia. If they get a rich experience over technology it can help the researchers to facilitate their theory into a workable project or product. Software Engineering could be a backbone where concepts can be transformed into productive algorithms and results can be automated. It can also set up a process path for executing a project. Problem statements can be set up by a software engineer for a group of students and academics.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="call-to-action">Call to Action&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In general, I have observed that RSEng is gaining recognition in broader conversations about Open Science, Open Source, etc. However, there seems to be a lack of direct attention towards this topic in the Asian region, as mentioned in a report on &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/blog/2022-10/">Expanding the mapping of the global research software community&lt;/a>.&amp;rdquo; To address this gap, I have been promoting awareness and leading the efforts to focus on RSEng within the APAN network (at APAN53 and APAN55). Given the breadth of the APAN network and NRENs in Asia, they could serve as a great hub for the research software community in the region. If you have any suggestions on how we can leverage NRENs to foster the growth of the RSEng community in Asia, please feel free to &lt;a href="mailto:kaur.saranjeet3@gmail.com">get in touch&lt;/a>. We might be able to submit a panel discussion on this topic at APAN56! Also feel free to share any ideas for other relevant conferences in the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;/p>
