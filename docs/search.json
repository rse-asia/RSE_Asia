It was launched on Thursday, 14th October 2021, which is also the first International RSE Day. At the launch event we conducted activities for contributing to Hacktoberfest 2021. Both Saranjeet and Jyoti graduated from the OLS-4 during early 2022 (graduation certificates below).\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, under the Pilot Mentoring Programme of the Society of Research Software Engineering, Saranjeet worked on the building community around the RSE Asia Association, mentored by Dr. Michelle Barker. Later on, Jyoti worked on a project titled “Building Pathways for Onboarding to Research Software Engineering (RSE) Asia Association and Adoption of Code of Conduct” as mentee in the the Open Life Science Cohort-5 programme (OLS-5) under the mentorship of Dr. Malvika Sharan.\nFounders\nSaranjeet Kaur Bhogal\nJyoti Bhogal\nAdvisory Board\nAnne Fouilloux\nMichelle Barker\nRowland Mosbergen\n\n\n\n",
